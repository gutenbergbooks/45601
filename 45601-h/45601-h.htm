<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />

<small>A NEW SONG</small></h2>


<p>The town itself was one that stood at the foot of
Virginia's blue mountains. The house where the
Corners lived was on the edge of the town, facing
a street which ended at the front gate. At the side
of the garden another long street wound its way
uphill and was called the old County Road when it
began to go down grade. The house was a rambling
old affair which had not been painted for
some years and was, therefore, of an indescribable
hue. One wing was shut up, but the remainder was
made excellent use of by four lively girls, of whom
the eldest was Nancy Weston. She was variously
known as Nan, Nance or Nannie, though she
greatly preferred Nannette and sometimes stealthily
signed herself so. When she was, as her Cousin
Phil expressed it, "on the bias," he often delighted
to tease her by calling her Sharp Corner, but her
Aunt Sarah often declared that West Corner suited
her perfectly since from that quarter sprang up the
briskest, as well as the most agreeable, of breezes.</p>

<p>Next to Nan came Mary Lee. She was always
called by both names as is a Virginia custom. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
Mary Lee came Jacqueline, or Jack as she was
called, and her twin sister, Jean. Mary Lee was
very unlike Nan, and though there was less than
two years difference in their ages, she seemed the
older of the two. She was less impetuous, more
quiet and reserved, though more self-absorbed and
less thoughtful for others. Neither was she so
original as Nan and generally followed some one's
lead, most frequently that of her Cousin Phil Lewis
who was her special comrade, for Mary Lee adored
open-air sports, especially boyish ones. Nan liked
these intermittently, though when she did enter
into them she was liable to be more daring and
impetuous than her sister.</p>

<p>Phil lived scarce a block away and, since the
confines of his own dooryard were limited, he
preferred to spend much of his time within the
larger range of his cousins' three acres. He and
Mary Lee were about the same age and had many
tastes in common; both were devoted to animals,
and had a tendency to fads over which they became
very enthusiastic for the time being. Phil
was a wiry, dark, little fellow quite Mary Lee's opposite,
she being fair-haired and blue-eyed with a
slow drawl in speaking. Nan spoke more nervously
when she was excited, though she, too, spoke
with a lingering accent upon certain words. Nan's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
eyes were sometimes a grayish blue, sometimes
almost a hazel, and at times showed the color of
deep and tranquil pools of water, an indescribable
hue. Their expression changed as did their color
and when languidly drooped under their long dark
lashes, seemed those of a sentimental romantic
maid, but, when in moments of excitement, Nan
opened them wide, they glowed like two stars. Her
eyes were Nan's best feature. She did not possess
a straight nose like Mary Lee's nor such a rosebud of
a mouth, but her flashing smile showed even, white
little teeth, and the oval of her face was perfect.</p>

<p>The twins were much alike in coloring and
feature, but in expression were so different that
even the most casual observer could not fail to
distinguish Jack from Jean. They had blue eyes
like Mary Lee but were dark-haired like Nan. Jack
was, as Aunt Sarah Dent expressed it, "a pickle."
She had a dreamy pathetic countenance and wore a
saintly expression when she was plotting her worst
mischief. At her best she was angelic; at her
worst she was impish, and just how she would
eventually turn out no one could foretell.</p>

<p>Jean was a sweet-tempered, affectionate child,
gentle and obedient. Once in a while it seemed as
if she felt it a duty to be naughty, but the naughtiness
was always as if it were a pretense, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
more of a bluster than an exhibition of actual
original sin. "There is no mistake that Jack is
full of the old Adam," Aunt Sarah was wont to declare,
"but Jean always acts to me as if she wasn't
quite sure that she ought to be human."</p>

<p>Nan was overflowing with sentiment, a lover of
music, books, and pictures, yet liking nothing
better than to whirl in and help in domestic
emergencies. She had much inventive and mechanical
talent which most of the others lacked.
She was usually the sunniest and most sweet-tempered
of persons, but had her moody days
when she "flocked by herself," and liked to brood
upon sombre subjects or weave lugubrious ballads
which she set to melancholy tunes. These moody
moments occurred but seldom and were generally
the outcome of hurt feelings after some teasing
bout with one of her sisters or some contrite condition
following a deserved lecture from her mother
or her Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah Dent often came to make long stays
with the family after the death of the children's
father. A small life insurance and the little place at
the end of the street was about all that was left to
their mother. Aunt Sarah had a modest income of
her own which she cheerfully added to the family
exchequer and, therefore, her coming usually meant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
some added comforts, so they managed fairly well.
A woman came in to wash and clean, but the rest
of the work was done by the family with the assistance
of a half-grown colored girl, and an old
negro man, Landy by name. It was supposed that
his name in its beginning had been Philander, but
he had forgotten and no one else knew. He was a
little bent, dried-up old darky, but was tough and
wiry and could accomplish more than many younger
ones of his color, whom he scorned openly.</p>

<p>Add to the family an old mule named Pete, a
handsome Angora cat called Lady Gray, and a mongrel
dog whose name was Trouble, and you have
its membership.</p>

<p>It was one afternoon in late summer that Nan,
having been called Sharp Corner more times than
her temper would amiably permit, had gone to a
haunt much favored by herself. This was at the
extreme edge of the place, a little nook where the
orchard ended and a few stunted pines lapped over
into the next field. The field had not been cultivated
for some time and was overgrown with
weeds and a young growth of pine and fir trees.
It was rather a desolate spot, for the nearest house
was hidden in summer by a thick grove, and the
slope of the hill prevented the road from being seen
from this point.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p>Creeping through the rail fence Nan felt that she
had placed herself outside trammeling conditions
and made her way to where a fallen log, covered
with moss, invited her. This was Nan's piano.
She seated herself upon a pile of sticks and stones
which she had heaped up before the log. In front
of her she had constructed a sort of rack, using a
bit of wood which she had nailed to the log.
Against the rack she placed a newspaper clipping
which she secured from blowing away by means
of a pin. After a few graceful sweeps of her hands
up and down the pretended key-board, she wailed
forth to a silent accompaniment:</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/i016.jpg">
<img src="images/i016_th.jpg"
alt="Music:
A lone-ly child goes wand'ring by,
Blue his eyes as sum-mer's sky,
On his lash-es tear-drops lie,
For his feet tread the dust-y av-e-nue,
Wea-ri-ly the whole day through
Home-less he and or-phaned too
Lit-tle Ja-mie."
 /></a>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>There was more of the song but Nan sang the
first stanza over and over again. At the close of the
performance her eyes were full of tears and her
voice vibrated with emotion as she quavered forth:
"Little Jamie." A flock of crows in the field beyond
rose from the stubbly undergrowth with
solemn caws and sailed off to the grove beyond.
The birds of ill-omen exactly suited Nan's mood.
She took an æsthetic delight in their presence.
They seemed to be applauding her. She went to
the other side of the log and lay down upon the
dry pine needles, her head against the log and her
eyes fixed upon the blue sky. Her thoughts were
with the verses she had cut from a country newspaper.
She thought they were delightful, and her
fancy brought before her an orphan boy tattered
and torn but beautiful as a dream. She felt all the
enthusiasm of a true composer as she hummed over
the tune she had made.</p>

<p>"I will publish it some day," she said. "The
next time everybody is busy and out of the sitting-room,
I will try to write it so I will not forget it. I
think, myself, that it is lovely and I ought to get a
great deal of money for it, enough to buy a piano."</p>

<p>The possession of a piano was Nan's dearest
wish. The only musical instrument of which the
family could boast was an old wheezy melodeon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
which stood in the sitting-room. It skipped notes
once in a while, especially in its middle range, and
was at once a source of pleasure and disappointment
to Nan. Her Aunt Sarah declared that it
drove her wild to hear Nan try to pick out tunes on
it, so the girl usually had to be sure of having the
place to herself before she dared to make attempts
at music. Feeble little attempts these were, for she
knew scarce anything beyond the mere rudiments.
But to a great love of music she added a true ear, a
good memory, and boundless ambition and perseverance.</p>

<p>"It will be autumn soon," Nan went on to herself,
her thoughts still wandering in a vague dream.
"I think I like autumn best of all seasons. I'd like
to write poetry about it. When I am a great musician,
I will write a piece of music and call it 'Autumn
Whispers,' and it will sound like the wind in
the trees and the corn shocks. Then I will write
another and that will be called 'Autumn Secrets.'
It will be about golden sunshine and shining red
leaves and little pools of water in the hollows that
look as if a piece of blue sky had dropped in them.
I wish I could write music that would be a picture
and a poem, too; it would be nice to have them all
together. Trouble, where did you come from? I
know Phil is around somewhere," she exclaimed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
suddenly, sitting up very straight. "I don't want
him to find me here. He has called me 'Sharp
Corner' once too often to-day."</p>

<p>She jumped up and bending low, ran along the
line of fence toward the hollow which intervened
between this and the next rise of ground. Trouble
stood still for a moment, uncertainly looking after
her, then he trotted off in an opposite direction.</p>

<p>Pursuing her way, Nan reached the small stream
which ran through the hollow. Ferns and mosses
were here in abundance. Here and there a cardinal
flower flaunted its red banner. Low aground
trailed the hedge bindweed, and in the field beyond a
slim spire of goldenrod showed itself. This attracted
Nan's notice. "I said it would be autumn soon,"
she said, "for there is the first goldenrod of the
season. I must get that piece for Aunt Sarah, though
if she has an idea of where it came from, she won't
have it." She gave a hasty glance in the direction
of the house beyond sheltering trees as she gained
the other side of the brook to gather her ambitious
spray of goldenrod, for that house set in the grove
of oaks belonged to Grandmother Corner, whose
grandchildren were strangers to her. The running
brook was the barrier which they seldom crossed
and, when they did, it was secretly. The big buff
house was closed, the green shutters tightly fastened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
the door boarded up and the gate locked, for its
owner was abroad. With her daughter Helen, she
had been in Europe ever since Nan could remember.</p>

<p>Sometimes Nan would push her way through the
hedge which surrounded the lawn, plunge through
the long grass and stand staring up at the silent
house where her father had been born. Certain accounts
given by old Landy made her believe that it
was of palatial magnificence and she longed to see
its interior. Once when the care-taker had made
one of his infrequent visits, one of the lower windows
was opened, and Nan who had long watched
and waited for such an opportunity, tiptoed up to
peep in. At first she saw nothing but ghostly
sheeted furniture and pictures shrouded in muslin
cases, bare floors and uncurtained windows. She
was about to creep away disappointed when she
saw the man upon a ladder uncovering a picture.
It was of a stately lady in a velvet gown, the
slender fingers half hidden by costly lace, and Nan
gazed with all her eyes at the haughty face. Was
it her grandmother's portrait, she wondered. She
watched till the man readjusted the covering and
then she crept away dreaming of a day when she
might see the original of the portrait and when she
might be allowed to walk through those silent
rooms again restored to their former splendor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>On this afternoon, however, she did not go near
the house, but followed the stream for a short distance,
crossed back again and came around the
other side of her own home garden where old
Landy was at work, talking to himself as was his
wont.</p>

<p>"Reckon dese yer vines is done fo'. Clar 'em
erway. No mo' beans on 'em. How co'n comin'
on? Get a mess offen dis row by Sunday. Tomats
plenty. Melons gittin' good an' ripe." He stooped
down to tap a large melon with his bony knuckles.
"She jest a bus'in' wid sweetness by 'nother week.
Um, um, she fa'r make me dribble at de mouf to
look at huh."</p>

<p>"Who-o-o!" came a long-drawn owlish cry
from behind him.</p>

<p>"Who dat?" cried Landy, pulling himself erect
from his contemplation of the melon. "Whicher
one o' yuh chilluns is it? Hyar, yuh, Jack er Phil er
whomsoever yuh is, git outen fum behin' dat co'n
brake. I sees yuh."</p>

<p>A suppressed giggle from Nan made known her
whereabouts, and she arose up from behind the tall
tasseled corn. "You didn't see me or you wouldn't
have called me Phil or Jack, but you heard me,
didn't you? Did you think I was a real sure enough
owl, Unc' Landy?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>"Humph! I knows ole hooty-owl better'n dat.
I knows yuh is a huming varmint."</p>

<p>"Oh, Unc' Landy! the idea of calling me a varmint.
I am not one at all."</p>

<p>"Den wha' fo' yuh grubbin' roun' in de gyardin'
stuff lak ole mole?" he asked chuckling.</p>

<p>"Same reason you do; to see how it is getting
on. When will the watermelons be ready to eat?
It seems to me they are very late this year."</p>

<p>"Dey is late. I say dey is, but nex' week, ef de
Lord sees fittin', we bus' open dis one. She de fust
to be pick. I layin' out to lif huh fum huh sandy
baid nex' Tuesday."</p>

<p>"And we'll have it for dinner. Oh, my! I wish
it were ready now. Did they used to have a watermelon
patch over at Grandmother Corner's? There
isn't any now."</p>

<p>"How yuh so wise?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I've been all around the place. I know just
where the garden used to be."</p>

<p>"Yo' ma say yuh chilluns ain't to ha'nt de ole
place."</p>

<p>"I know and I don't haunt it; I just go there once
in a while. I haven't been for a long, long time.
I don't see, anyhow, why we can't go when it was
father's home."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yuh nuvver sees yo' ma er yo' auntie cross de
brook."</p>

<p>"No, but then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Den wha' fo' yuh do what dey don' do?"</p>

<p>"I do lots of things which they don't do and
they do lots of things I don't do; that's no reason.
When do you reckon my Grandmother Corner will
come back?"</p>

<p>"Das mo'n any huming know, I tell yuh, honey.
She done taken huh disagreeables an' huh hity-tyties
long wid huh. Das all I kyar to know. She want
de yarth an' all dat derein is, das what she want;
mebbe she fin' it off yandah in dem quare countries,
but she don't git back dem ha'sh words she speak
to yo' pa on his las' day. Dey a-follerin' huh an' a
gnawin' an' a clawin' at huh heart. She cyarnt git
rid o' dem wha'soevah she go, though she try to
flee fum 'em."</p>

<p>The picture of her grandmother's fleeing from
place to place pursued by bitter words in the form
of skeleton-like creatures who gnashed their teeth
and clawed with bony fingers took hold of Nan's
imagination. Her mother never mentioned Grandmother
Corner's name, and from old Landy Nan
gleaned all that she knew of her. Heretofore,
what had been told her did not cause her to give<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
much love to this unknown grandmother, but now
she began to feel rather sorry for her. "I wish
you took care of the big house," she said, "for
then you could let me go in there to see the pictures
and beautiful things, and I could play on the piano."</p>

<p>"Humph! I say let you in. Ef it depen' upon
ole Landy yuh ain' nuvver go inside de do'. Nobody
tell me go but onct. I ain't nuvver pass my foot
ovah de do'-sill agin whilst I lives on dis yarth."</p>

<p>While he talked Landy slashed away at the dead
vines vindictively. As he clawed at them with his
lean black fingers he made Nan think of the bitter
words which pursued her grandmother. They
must appear something like Landy, only more bony
and wicked-looking. Nan laughed at the conceit.</p>

<p>"'Tain't nothin' to larf at," grumbled Landy.
"Dese yer fambly q'urrels is turrble things. Yo' pa
know yo' gran'ma don't like be crossed 'bout de
proputty, but he feel lak he bleedged to say what
he think, an' she tu'n on him an' de las' word she
uvver give mek him have de heart-ache. Yo' ma
ain' fergit dat, an' das fo' why she don' lak you
chilluns to go trespassin' on de ole place. Hit yo'
gran'ma's an' she got full an' plenty whilst yo' pa
what oughter had his share done got nothin' ter
leave yuh-alls but dis little ole place. Das why I
laks ter mek hit smile an' see de melons grow plum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
big an' de co'n-fiel' lookin' prosp'ous. Yo' gran'pa
mean yo' pa to hev his shar' but de ole lady hol' on
to uvvry thing whilst she 'bove groun'. Nemmin',
yuh-alls has full an' plenty to eat. Ain' de tomats
jest a-humpin' deyse'fs? Yo' ma has pickles an'
cans o' 'em fo' de whole wintah, dey so many."</p>

<p>"I like the little yellow ones best," remarked
Nan, who was tired of the old man's long monologue.
He was given to reciting these bits of family
history to her though to no one outside the family
itself would he have breathed a word. "I
think these make the very nicest preserves," continued
Nan, "and I like them raw, too. I always
feel as if I were eating golden fairy fruit only they
aren't sweet like I imagine fairy fruit would be."
She stooped to gather a tiny red tomato from the
vines at her feet. They used to call these love-apples,
Aunt Sarah says, and they thought they were
poisonous. "I am glad they found out it wasn't so,"
she said, popping the red morsel into her mouth.
"What are you going to do now, Landy?"</p>

<p>"Gwine tek a tu'n at de fence." When Landy's
other occupations did not demand attention there
was always the fence to turn to; something upon
which to exhaust his energies. It was patched and
mended beyond hope now, Mrs. Corner thought,
and the repairs were creeping from the side to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
front, for Landy had frequently "borrowed from
Peter to pay Paul," and when a paling was missing
from the front he had always promptly supplied it
from the sides, replacing it by a board, a post, or
whatever came handy, so that the two side fences
presented a curious style of building. White,
green or gray boards took their place as occasion
required. Tops from empty boxes set forth some
address in staring black letters, a bit of wire fence
was hitched to a cedar post on one side and an old
bed-slat on the other; but the fence served its purpose
to keep out wandering cattle from the garden
which was Landy's pride. And though Mrs. Corner
sighed when she went that way, there was no
money to be spared for new fences so the old one
was eked out from year to year.</p>

<p>Leaving Landy to work upon the fence, Nan supplied
herself with more small tomatoes and went up
to the house thinking of the grandmother across
seas and determining to curb her own tongue lest
it lead her into such trying ordeals as the being
haunted by bitter words.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />

<small>THE FAIRY GODMOTHER</small></h2>


<p>As she entered the long living-room, Nan found
it deserted except for the presence of Lady Gray,
who sleepily stretched out her paws on the broad
window-sill where she was taking a nap, and
winked one eye at Nan. "Nobody here, at least
nobody who counts, if you will excuse the remark,
Lady Gray," said Nan, "so I can try my song."</p>

<p>She went to the corner where the melodeon
stood. It was piled high with a variety of things;
her mother's work-basket, Aunt Sarah's knitting, a
scrap-book, and some sheets of paper from which
Nan was taking cuttings, the twins' dolls, and a pile
of books which she herself had taken from the
shelves. All these had to be removed before the
song could be tried.</p>

<p>The warm summer sunshine sifted in through the
vines that covered the western windows and disclosed
the dinginess of the room. An old-fashioned
paper, discolored by time, covered the walls; its
green and gold had been pleasant to look upon in
days gone by, but now it was patched and streaked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
Upon the floor was a worn carpet; handsome old
mahogany furniture which had lost its polish gave
a well-filled appearance to the room, though the
springs of the long sofa had been greatly weakened
by frequent jumpings upon them, so that the seat
of the sofa presented an uphill and down-dale surface,
not rendered more inviting by the neutral-toned,
frayed upholstery.</p>

<p>A tall secretary with a beautifully leaded glass top
had been chosen by some yellow-jackets as a place
for building purposes, and they were droning about
their mud-bedaubed residences along the edge of
the secretary's top.</p>

<p>A handsome centre-table with claw feet was
littered with books and magazines. A set of chairs
in about the same condition as the sofa evidenced
that a constant use had been made of them. The
shades at the windows were in a more or less
worn condition. Over the mantel hung a portrait
of a man in gray uniform, one hand on his sword.
His eyes were like Nan's.</p>

<p>Nan began industriously to pick out her tune by
working the pedals of the old melodeon vigorously,
an operation which was followed by a long-drawn
wheezing complaint from somewhere in the interior
of the instrument. But Nan did not perceive
any reason for amusement; she carefully wrote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
down her notes one by one, saying aloud "<i>D</i>, <i>d</i>, <i>f</i>,
<i>a</i>,&mdash;I wish that note would sound. I think it must
be <i>a&mdash;b</i>, <i>a</i>,&mdash;I wonder if it is <i>a</i>; it comes so often,
too, I ought to know. Oh, dear, <i>e</i> is out of order,
too. Let me see, where was I? Oh, yes, 'blue
his eyes,' it is eyes that ought to be <i>e</i>. I reckon
I'll know what it is anyhow, even if I don't get
it exactly right. 'Blue his eyes,'" she sang
softly.</p>

<p>"Nannie," came a voice from the window, "do
shut up that dreadful wheezing thing; I want to
take a nap."</p>

<p>Nan jumped up and closed the melodeon with a
bang. Why was it that Aunt Sarah always wanted
to take a nap when she was "composing"? It
was always so. Aunt Sarah might go days and
never think of napping in the daytime, but let Nan
but send forth one note and, if Aunt Sarah were
anywhere within hearing distance, there came the
order to stop. "I wish I could have it all to myself
somewhere out of the way," she said. "I'll ask
mother if I may get Landy to take it over in one of
the old rooms, or up in the attic or somewhere so
nobody will hear me."</p>

<p>Acting upon this idea she sought out her mother
who was busy at her sewing-machine. Mrs.
Corner looked up brightly, though she did not stop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
her work when Nan appeared. "Well, daughter?"
she said.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, mayn't I have the old melodeon all
to myself somewhere; over in the barn, or in one
of the shut up rooms of the wing or in the garret
or somewhere so nobody can hear when I am
playing?"</p>

<p>"Playing?" An amused pucker came around
Mrs. Corner's eyes. "It is truly playing that you
do with it. I don't see how I can let you have it,
for it is so useful to pile things on in the living-room."</p>

<p>"But mother, a table would do just as well."</p>

<p>"If one had the table."</p>

<p>"I'm sure there must be one somewhere in the
garret."</p>

<p>"None that is whole."</p>

<p>"There's one that is only a little rickety in the
legs, and Landy could mend that."</p>

<p>"Landy has no time for such things, at least, unless
they are absolutely necessary. He has all that
he can do."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I do want it so very much. Aunt
Sarah always wants to take a nap the minute I begin
to play and I always have to stop."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner smiled again. "I'm not surprised.
Don't be unreasonable, Nan. You know it is trying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
to hear any one wheeze out impossible tunes with
one finger, or make distracting discords which are
agony to a sensitive ear. You are getting too big
to want to drum."</p>

<p>A lump arose in Nan's throat. She was shy of
divulging her ambitions. Her mother did not understand
that she did not want to drum, but that
this was a serious matter. She would not explain,
however, but she hurried away with a sense of being
aggrieved. Mary Lee and Phil were at that
moment deeply interested in watching a family of
tadpoles which were about to lose their tails. The
two children kept them in an old half-cask and
spent many moments in bending over it. Jack and
Jean were playing house with paper-dolls in the
orchard. No one wanted Nan and she did want
her music. She made one more attempt, returning
slowly to her mother's door. "If you only just
knew, mother, how awfully much I want it, you'd
let me have it."</p>

<p>Her mother stopped stitching. "Poor little girl,"
she spoke sympathetically, "I wish you could have
lessons, and that I could give you a good piano to
practice on, for I do appreciate your love of music,
but dear, I don't see that your efforts on that old
worn-out melodeon will bring you the slightest reward;
in fact, I have heard it said that it is not well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
to allow a child to practice on a poor instrument.
Now, be reasonable, darling, and don't want impossibilities.
You know mother would give you
your every heart's desire if she could."</p>

<p>"I know," said Nan weakly as she turned again
from the room. A sudden inspiration had seized
her, and her heart beat very fast as she made her
way back to the retreat in the pines and from there
to the hollow and on to the very threshold of the
house at Uplands, the old Corner place. She tried
the door but it did not yield to her efforts. From
window to window she went making an effort to
open each. To the side door, the back door and
around to the porch on the north side. There were
side lights to the door here, and, shading her eyes,
Nan tried to peer through into the dimness.</p>

<p>Nan thought she heard sounds within and felt a
little scared, then all at once she saw a form in black
garments flit across the hall, and with a suppressed
scream she turned and fled, crashing through the
weeds and underbrush, leaping across the brook
and reaching her retreat frightened and wondering.
There could be no mistake; some one was certainly
there. Was it flesh and blood presence or some
ghostly visitor? Uplands had the reputation of
being haunted and Nan really believed she had seen
the ghost of her great-great-grandmother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p>She sat quaking and yet half trying to make up
her mind to return for further investigation when a
shadow fell across the spot where she sat, and,
looking up, she saw a strange little lady standing
before her, looking down at her wistfully. The
lady was all in black and though her face was
young, and her cheeks showed softly pink, her hair
was very white. Nan had not seen her approach,
and it appeared almost as if she had dropped from
the skies. "Who are you?" inquired the little
lady.</p>

<p>"One of the four Corners," returned Nan with a
sudden smile.</p>

<p>"Which one?"</p>

<p>"Nan."</p>

<p>"I was sure of it. And why were you trying to
get into that house?" The little lady nodded toward
Uplands.</p>

<p>"Because it is my grandmother's and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;"
She glanced up shyly at the stranger.</p>

<p>"Go on, please," said the lady, taking a seat on
an end of Nan's pretended piano. "Did you want
anything in particular?"</p>

<p>There was something compelling in the lady's
manner, and Nan replied, "Yes, I did. I know I
really ought not to have gone, for mother doesn't
like us even to cross the brook. She never actually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
forbids it, but she looks distressed if she finds out
that any of us have been over, but I wanted awfully
to see if I could get in and try to open the piano.
It seems so perfectly dreadful for it to stand there
month after month and year after year, no good to
anybody, when I'd give my right hand to have it."</p>

<p>"If you gave your right hand for it," said the
lady, suddenly dimpling, "you could only play
bass, you know, and I don't believe you would care
for that."</p>

<p>Nan laughed. "No, I wouldn't. I like the fine
high notes, though sometimes I think the growling
bass of the organ at church is beautiful. It makes
me think of what it says in the Psalter: 'The noise
of the seas, the noise of the waves, and the tumult
of the people.'"</p>

<p>The lady nodded understandingly and was silently
thoughtful for some moments, then she said, "This
is a nice little spot." She put her hand upon Nan's
improvised music-rack. "What is this for?" she
asked.</p>

<p>Nan blushed. "It's just to hold up the music,
you know. That's my piano where you are sitting."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" cried the lady, jumping up. "How
undignified of me to sit on a piano. Please pardon
me; I didn't know."</p>

<p>"Of course not." Nan's eyes grew starlike. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
was not only very delightful but very exciting to
meet one who so perfectly understood. "You see,"
she went on, "all I have at home is a dreadful old
melodeon that skips notes and wheezes like our old
Pete; he has the heaves, you know."</p>

<p>"Poor old Pete," said the lady, with a tender
retrospective look in her eyes. "You have the
melodeon, yes, and then?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Sarah always wants to take a nap the
minute I begin to play, and to-day," her voice
dropped and she went nearer to her visitor, "I had
made a new tune and I did so want to write it down.
I came out here first and tried it; it sounded very
well, I thought, but I had written only a little of it
when I had to shut the melodeon. Aunt Sarah always
does have such inconvenient times for taking
naps," she sighed.</p>

<p>"Won't you let me hear your song, or your tune?"
said the lady, politely seating herself with an expectant
air upon a stump further off.</p>

<p>Nan's cheeks grew redder. She did not like to
seem ungracious to this stranger who showed
such an unusual interest in her performances and
yet her only audience heretofore had been the
creatures of the field and the air. "No one has ever
heard it but the crows," she said hesitatingly, then
impulsively: "You won't laugh?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed no, of course not," returned the lady
with some real indignation at such a suspicion.</p>

<p>Nan sat still long enough to screw up her courage
to the active point, and then drawing from her
blouse a bit of paper, she seated herself before her
log-piano and began her song. The lady, with
cheek in hand, leaned forward and listened intently.
Once there was a slight flicker of amusement in her
eyes, but for the most part her face was tenderly
serious. At the close of the song she said gently:
"Thank you, dear. I think that is a very sweet little
air for one so young as you to think of. May
I see?" She extended her hand for Nan's half-written
song. "How will you finish it?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I'll have to wait till Aunt Sarah
goes out or goes away. I hope I shall not forget it
before then. I'll sing it over every day and then
maybe I won't forget."</p>

<p>The lady looked at her thoughtfully for a minute.
"Can you keep a secret?" she asked suddenly.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. Why, nobody, not even Mary Lee,
has an idea about this." She waved her hand to include
her music-room retreat.</p>

<p>"Then promise not to tell a soul."</p>

<p>"I promise." Nan's eyes grew eager.</p>

<span class="caption">She Seated Herself Before Her Log Piano and Began Her Song</span>
</div>



<p>"I am your fairy godmother, and if you will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
meet me under the sunset tree to-morrow morning
at ten o'clock, I will conduct you to a place where
you can finish your song undisturbed, for I guarantee
Aunt Sarah will not be caught napping within hearing
of you and the melodeon."</p>

<p>"Oh, how perfectly delicious," cried Nan, her
imagination all afire. "I'd love that. Where is
the sunset tree? It is such a lovely name for
it."</p>

<p>The lady pointed to a huge oak just across the
brook. "It is called that because one can see the
sunset so finely from there. Have you never been
up to look at the sun go down behind the hills?
There is one little notch between the mountains
over there and at a certain season of the year the sun
drops right down into it."</p>

<p>"I have never seen it," said Nan, regretfully. "I
wonder why no one ever told me about it. I
think sunset tree is such a lovely name and it is just
the spot for a trysting place. It would be a lovely
secret, but I never had a real important one from
mother before. I shall have to tell her about going
up there; not right away, but some day. It
always comes out sooner or later and I would rather
tell just mother, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"So you may. I'm glad you feel that way about
it. Little girls should never have secrets they cannot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
tell their mothers. In three days you may tell her,
if you think it would be right to keep silence that
long."</p>

<p>"Oh, that will not be very long. I could keep the
secret longer if you said so."</p>

<p>"That will be long enough. Now, shut your
eyes while you count one hundred slowly or the
queen of the fairies will not let me appear again.
The spell will be broken if you so much as peep, or
if you do not count aloud."</p>

<p>Nan closed her eyes very tight and began to
count. She gave a little interrupting gasp as she
felt a light kiss on her cheek, but she kept steadily
on till she had reached the desired number. Then
she opened her eyes and looked around. There was
no one in sight. The afternoon sun was sinking behind
the trees, and the cows were returning home
along the county road. With the weight of such a
secret as she had never before carried, Nan ran
home in a happy tumult of excited expectation. At
the back of the house she came upon Mary Lee and
Phil still absorbed in their polywogs.</p>

<p>"Come see," cried Mary Lee, "they are too
funny for anything, Nan. They are the interestingest
things I ever saw."</p>

<p>Nan went up to look. "What is so wonderful
about polywogs?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'd think yourself wonderful," said Phil indignantly,
"if you could change yourself from a
swimming beast into a hopping one and be as awfully
amphibious as they are."</p>

<p>Nan laughed and drew her finger slowly through
the water in the cask. "They aren't half so wonderful
as fairies," she said. "They can change
themselves into all sorts of things."</p>

<p>"Oh, pshaw! Everybody knows that there are no
real fairies. These can really change before your
very eyes; we've watched them from day to day,
haven't we, Mary Lee?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we have," was the answer. "Nan always
likes foolish make-believe things, but we like the
real ones."</p>

<p>"Fairy godmothers are real," Nan answered back
over her shoulder as she left the pair discussing the
proper treatment of their present pets. They paid
no attention to her speech and she laughed to herself,
exulting in her secret. Before she reached the
house she heard a wail from the direction of the
orchard, and perceived Jean sitting on the ground
under a tree. As Nan approached, she whimpered
softly.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, kitten?" asked Nan.</p>

<p>"Jack was pretending I was a calf," said Jean,
mournfully, "and she hobbled me to the tree so I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
couldn't get to my mother, and now she's gone off
and I can't get the rope untied."</p>

<p>"Poor little calf, and the cows all coming home,
too. Never mind, I'll untie you. Where is Jack?"</p>

<p>"She was going for her cows, but I reckon she's
done forgot it."</p>

<p>"Don't say done forgot; that sounds like Mitty
and Unc' Landy."</p>

<p>Jean hung her head. She was used to these chidings
from her eldest sister. She had a curious
babyish way of speaking, not being easily able to
make the sounds of <i>th</i> or <i>qu</i>. "I know it isn't
crite right," she said, "but I forget sometimes."</p>

<p>Nan put her arms around her. "Of course you
do. We all forget some things sometimes. Come
with me and let us hunt up Jack. I'll venture to
say she's in some mischief."</p>

<p>She was not far wrong in her conjectures, for
after a half hour's diligent searching, Jack was
found. She had discovered a can of white paint,
supplied by Aunt Sarah for the betterment of the
front fence which Landy had proudly commenced
to adorn with a shining coat of whiteness. He had
been called away when he had made but little
progress and Jack had taken up the job with great
glee. She was in the height of her enjoyment,
daubing on great masses of white which dribbled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
down the palings wastefully. The child herself
was smeared from hair ribbon to shoe-strings and
was a sight to behold.</p>

<p>"Jack Corner!" exclaimed Nan. "You dreadful
child! Just look at you, and, oh, dear, how you are
wasting paint. It won't begin to be enough to
finish the fence the way you have been using it.
Unc' Landy will give you Jesse."</p>

<p>"Some one's always giving me Jesse," complained
Jack. "You all keep saying Unc' Landy
has so much to do and I am only helping him."</p>

<p>"Pretty help, using up the paint and ruining your
clothes. March yourself straight into the house,
miss." Nan took hold of Jack's shoulder which
was twitched away, and with a vicious fling of the
dripping brush directly at Nan, Jack turned and
fled.</p>

<p>"She is the most trying child," said Nan, deftly
dodging the brush, though not without receiving
some drops upon her frock. "I declare, there isn't a
day when she doesn't do something dreadful."</p>

<p>"She just fought she was helping," put in Jean,
always ready to defend her twin by imputing
worthy motives to her performances.</p>

<p>"Maybe she did, but it's pretty poor help," said
Nan, stooping to pick a plantain leaf with which to
wipe off the worst spots from her skirt. "Aunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Sarah was so good as to buy the paint. I know she
went without something to do it, and now for Jack
to do her so mean as to play this scurvy trick is too
bad. I'm all done out with Jack. It's lucky we
found her when we did or there wouldn't have
been even as much paint as there is. I must go tell
Unc' Landy at once. Maybe he can scrape off some
of this before it dries. Help indeed! It gives him
double work." Her last words were spoken to
thin air, for Jean had hurried off to comfort Jack
and Nan was left to break the news to Unc' Landy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />

<small>NAN'S SECRET</small></h2>


<p>When Nan opened her eyes the next morning it
was with a consciousness that something pleasantly
exciting was to happen, and she lost no time in
hurrying down-stairs and, after breakfast, in getting
through her prescribed duties with more than
usual haste. Her mother smiled to see that she was
so eager and businesslike and that her moodiness
of the day before had departed, while Aunt Sarah
said: "I hope your fancy will not lead you to try
the tune the old cow died of to-day, Nannie."</p>

<p>Nan smiled but made no reply. What matter if
Aunt Sarah did cast slurs upon her musical attempts?
There were persons in the world who took
them seriously, and she felt a thrill of satisfaction as
she thought of the soft white hair and blue eyes of
her fairy godmother.</p>

<p>It was with some difficulty that she was able to
reach the sunset tree without being seen. Jack, in
penitential mood, and Jean looking for sympathy,
followed her everywhere, and it was not till she had
robbed a rose bush of its red berry-like seeds and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
had constructed a wonderful set of dishes, a lamp,
and a whole family of people from the berries, that
the reward of her ingenuity came to her in the delight
of the children over these novel toys and in
their content with a corner of the porch for a playroom.
After seeing them well established, Nan set
off.</p>

<p>"I've dusted the living-room, made my bed,
picked up after Jack, and I believe that is all," she
told herself. "There's Phil coming, I am thankful
to say, so Mary Lee will not tag me." She paid no
heed to the question, "Where are you going?"
which Mary Lee called after her, but kept on till
the barn hid her from sight. She hoped she had
not kept her friend waiting and that she would not
become impatient and leave, for it was after ten.
But as she came up to the tree she saw the sombre
little figure sitting quietly there. "I was so afraid
you couldn't wait," said Nan breathlessly. "The
children were so tiresome and wanted all sorts of
things done for them so I couldn't get away before."</p>

<p>"There's plenty of time," replied her friend.
"Sit down and cool off; you've come too fast
in the hot sun. Tell me about the children."</p>

<p>"Jean is a dear, and Jack can be perfectly fascinating
when she chooses. They are the twins, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>know. Jack's name is Jacqueline. Aunt Sarah says
she was mixed together with more original sin
than any of us, and if there hadn't been a lot of
angel used in her make up she doesn't know what
would become of her. She is simply dear this
morning, but yesterday afternoon!" And Nan
gave an account of Jack's muddle with the paint.</p>

<p>Her companion laughed. "She must keep you
in hot water," she said. "Tell me about Mary
Lee."</p>

<p>"Oh, do you know there is a Mary Lee?" said Nan
in surprise. "But of course everybody knows us.
She is named for our mother, and I am named for
papa's sister Nancy Weston who died. We called
Jack and Jean after papa. His name was John and
Jean is the French for John, only we give it the
Scotch pronunciation. Papa was always called
Jack and so Jacqueline is called that."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know&mdash;I mean I see," returned her companion.
"Come, now, shall we go on? Are you
ready to be conducted to the place of your desires?
You must go blindfolded."</p>

<p>"How lovely! That makes it so deliciously mysterious.
I hope I shall not fall and bump my
nose."</p>

<p>"I'll take care that you do not. Let me tie this
ever your eyes." She drew a soft silken scarf from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>a bag she held, and made it fast over Nan's eyes.
"Can you see?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, indeed, I can't. Not the leastest little
bit."</p>

<p>"Now give me your hands. There, I'll put
them around my waist and you will walk just
behind me."</p>

<p>Their way was made very cautiously and slowly
and at last Nan set foot upon a board floor. "Now
I can lead you," said her guide. "One step up,
please."</p>

<p>Nan was led along the floor for some distance
making one sharp turn, and then was gently forced
to a seat. "There," said her guide. "Sit here
perfectly still till you hear a bell ring; then you
may untie your scarf, but you must not leave the
room till I come for you."</p>

<p>Nan sat very still. Presently she heard a light
footstep cross the floor, then a door closed and
after a few minutes a bell in the distance tinkled
softly. Up went her hands and the scarf was
withdrawn in a jiffy. She found herself sitting
before an open piano. On each side of her were
set lighted candles in tall brass candlesticks. Into
the room no gleam of daylight made its way. In
the shadowy corners were sheeted chairs and sofas
and on the wall were covered pictures. Nan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>recognized the place at once. It was the drawing-room
of her grandmother's house and over the
mantel must be the very portrait she had once
gazed upon with such delight. Now it was
screened from view. "I just wonder who in the
world she is," exclaimed Nan thinking of her guide.
"I'd like to know how she got in here and all
about it. Perhaps she is some of our kinsfolk who
has come down here to look after something for
grandmother. I'm going to ask her."</p>

<p>Having made this decision, she turned her attention
to the piano. In spite of long disuse it
gave forth mellow and delightful tones as she
touched it softly. It seemed very big and important
after the little melodeon, but soon the girl
gained confidence and became absorbed in writing
down her little song which she did note by note,
calling each aloud. "I am not sure that it is just
right," she said as she concluded her task, "but it
is as right as I can make it."</p>

<p>She arose from her seat and tiptoed around the
room, lifting the covers from the shrouded furniture
and getting glimpses of dim brocade and silky plush.
Then she went back to the piano. All was so still
in the house that Nan felt the absolute freedom of
one without an audience. She touched the keys
gently at first, but, gaining confidence and inspiration,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>went on playing by ear snatches of this and
that, becoming perfectly absorbed in the happiness
of making melody.</p>

<p>She was so carried away by her performance
that she neither saw nor heard the door open
and was not aware of any one's presence till a
soft voice said: "I declare, the blessed child really
has talent."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Nan sprang to her feet. "Were you
listening?"</p>

<p>"I have been for a short time only. How did you
get along with your song?"</p>

<p>"Pretty well. I don't know whether it is exactly
right. I don't know much about time, and sharps
and flats."</p>

<p>"May I see? Perhaps I can help you."</p>

<p>Nan timidly held out her little awkwardly written
tune and the lady scanned it carefully. "You
haven't your sharps and naturals just right," she remarked.
"You see this is the sign of a natural,"
and taking Nan's pencil she made the necessary corrections,
then sitting down to the piano she played
the simple air through and afterward went off into
a dreamy waltz while Nan listened spellbound.</p>

<p>"Please tell me who you are," the child cried
when the music ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did tell you. I am your fairy godmother.
You may leave out the fairy if you like, for I am
quite substantial."</p>

<p>"Are you kin to&mdash;to grandmother? Did she
send you?"</p>

<p>"She did not send me and has no idea I am
here."</p>

<p>Nan stared. "I know, of course, just where I
am," she said. "This is Grandmother Corner's
house. I saw into this very room once and I saw
that," she indicated the portrait. "I just saw it for
a minute and I do so want to see it real good.
Could I?" she asked, wistfully.</p>

<p>"Why do you want to see it?" asked her companion.</p>

<p>"Because I love it. Oh, I know, I know," she
went on hastily. "Landy has told me."</p>

<p>"Has told you what?"</p>

<p>"I can't tell you unless you are kinsfolk."</p>

<p>"You can tell me anything because there is nothing
I don't know about this house and those who
used to live here."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, you know how cruel my grandmother
was to papa, and how she couldn't bear his marrying
mother."</p>

<p>"It wasn't because it was herself," put in the
other eagerly. "There was no objection to Mary
personally, but she hated to give him up to any one.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>She would have felt the same way if he had wanted
to marry a princess. She never did get over the
fact of sharing him with some one else; she never
will."</p>

<p>"I didn't know all that, but I knew about the bitter
words and how they have been haunting her,
and I feel so very sorry for her. I know it would
break my mother's heart to lose one of us," said
Nan, "and if she had been cross to us and anything
had happened that we were hurt meantime she
would never forgive herself. Why, when Jack has
been her naughtiest, mother never misses kissing
her good-night. Last night Jack had to be put
right to bed for punishment and before I went to
sleep I heard mother in the nursery and Jack was
crying, then when mother came to kiss me good-night
I saw she had been crying, too. She is such
a dear mother."</p>

<p>"She must be," said the little lady, her voice
a-tremble, "and you are right to feel sorry for your
grandmother. She needs all your love and sympathy."</p>

<p>"I wonder if I shall ever see her," said Nan wistfully.</p>

<p>"I hope so. I think so."</p>

<p>"And may I see the picture?"</p>

<p>"It is too high to reach, I am afraid."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, but I can get a pole or something and lift
up the cover," said Nan, quick to see a way.</p>

<p>"Run, then, and find one."</p>

<p>Nan disappeared and soon returned with an ancient
broom, the handle of which was used to lift
the cover sufficiently so that by the dim light of
the candles, which her friend held high, Nan beheld
the portrait again.</p>

<p>"Thank you, so much," she said gratefully. "I
am very glad you are kin of ours, even if I don't
know who you are. I love you and I am going to
try to love my grandmother."</p>

<p>The little lady suddenly put her arms around her
and held her close. "You are a dear, dear child,
and I love you, too," she said. "Some day you
shall see me again. Kiss me, Nancy."</p>

<p>Nan held up her sweet red mouth to receive the
warm kiss. "I shall be seeing your grandmother
before long," said her friend, holding the girl's hands
and looking tenderly at her.</p>

<p>"But she is in Europe."</p>

<p>"And are there no steamers that cross the
ocean?"</p>

<p>"Are you going there, then?"</p>

<p>"That is my intention."</p>

<p>"Then, are you going to tell her about me? Will
she care to know?" Nan paused before she said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>hesitatingly, "Would it make her very mad if I sent
a kiss to her?"</p>

<p>"Dear child, no. It would make her very glad,
and would help to ease her sad heart, I am
sure."</p>

<p>"Then I'll do it. Take this, please." Nan pressed
a hearty kiss on the lady's lips. "Then," she added:
"I must tell mother, you know."</p>

<p>"Of course. You may tell her day after to-morrow
that you met your godmother."</p>

<p>"My fairy godmother."</p>

<p>"As you like. Now you must run along. Good-bye
till we meet again. One more kiss, Nannie, for
your Aunt Helen."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I always forget her. I was so little
when I last saw her, you know. But I'll send her
a kiss if you want me to. Good-bye, dear fairy
godmother. Ask the queen of the fairies to send
you this way soon again."</p>

<p>The candle-lighted room, the little white-haired
figure, the shrouded portrait all seemed unreal as
Nan stepped out again into the bright sunlight.
She longed to tell her mother all about it, but she reflected
that the secret was not all her own and determined
to be silent till the time was up. Only one
question did she ask and the answer almost made
her betray herself. "Mother," she said when her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>mother came to say good-night, "who was my godmother?"</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Helen," was the reply.</p>

<p>Nan sat straight up in bed her eyes wide with
surprise. "Why, why," she stammered, but she
immediately nestled down again.</p>

<p>"Did you never know that?" asked her mother.</p>

<p>"If I did I forgot," replied Nan, and she lay awake
for a long time thinking of the strangeness of the
morning's experience. She could scarcely wait till
the time rolled around and brought her to the day
when she could tell her mother the story of her
secret meeting. It seemed to her that since the day
before yesterday her mental self had grown prodigiously.
Mary Lee, a year and a half younger
seemed now such a child, although heretofore
she had been considered the more mature. Once
in a while the two had discussed their grandmother
and the Corner family, but Mary Lee was not
greatly interested in the subject and had concluded
the conversation by saying: "I don't care a
picayune where she is or what she thinks. She
has never done anything for me and she might
as well be out of the world as in it, as far as
we are concerned. I'm never going to bother my
head about her, and I don't see why you want to,
Nan."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>
<p>This crushing indifference satisfied Nan that Mary
Lee was not to be confided in when the silent house
at Uplands, like a magnet, drew Nan toward it,
and she was rather glad that she did not want to
tell any one but her mother, for had a sympathetic
spirit been ready to hear the secret would have been
hard to keep.</p>

<p>When the eventful day came she followed Mrs.
Corner from dining-room to pantry and from pantry
to kitchen waiting for a chance to give her confidence.
"When shall you be through, mother?"
she asked. "It seems as if you had so much more
than usual to do this morning."</p>

<p>"No more, than always," returned her mother.
"Why are you so impatiently following me up,
Nan? What is it? Can't you tell me now?"</p>

<p>Nan glanced at Mitty and the washerwoman who
were eating their breakfast. "It's a secret," she
said in a low tone, "a very important secret."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner smiled. Nan's secrets were not
usually of great importance except in her own estimation.
"Well, I shall be in my room as soon as I
give out the meal and sugar; you can come to me
then, if you can't tell me here. Suppose you pass
the time away in looking up Jack. It is about time
she was getting into mischief again. She always
chooses Monday morning for some sort of escapade;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>I suppose keeping bottled up over Sunday is too
much for her."</p>

<p>"I'll go see where she is," agreed Nan. "She
won't be painting the fence this time, I know."</p>

<p>Jack was discovered before a tub in the wash
house. In the absence of Ginny, the washerwoman,
at breakfast, she had seized the opportunity of taking
her place and was about to plunge her best
muslin frock into the water with the stockings and
underwear when Nan came upon her. "Jacqueline
Corner, what are you up to now?" cried Nan,
snatching the frock from her.</p>

<p>"I'm just helping Ginny to wash," replied Jack
with her usual air of injured innocence when discovered
under such circumstances.</p>

<p>"You were just helping Landy when you wasted
the paint and ruined your blue frock," said Nan
sarcastically. "Walk yourself right out of here.
Ginny is perfectly capable of doing the washing
without your assistance. Besides that lawn frock
doesn't go in with black stockings; a pretty mess
you'd make of it. Ginny won't thank you for mixing
up her wash when she's sorted it all out. Try
your energies upon something you know about,
young lady."</p>

<p>Jack flung herself away. "You're always saying
I mustn't do this and I mustn't do that," she complained.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>"You're a regular old cross-patch.
You're not my mother to order me around."</p>

<p>"Mother sent me to see after you, so there," returned
Nan. "I'm next to mother, too, for I'm next
oldest. Where's Jean?"</p>

<p>"I don't know and I don't care," returned Jack,
sullenly.</p>

<p>"Who's a cross-patch now? Here comes
Ginny; you'd better make tracks out of here."</p>

<p>Jack fled and Nan returned to the house to find
her mother ready to sit down to her sewing. The
girl carefully shut the door and then established
herself on an ottoman near her mother. "What
does my Aunt Helen look like?" she asked abruptly.</p>

<p>Her mother looked up in surprise. "That's the
second time lately that you have asked me about
your Aunt Helen. Why this sudden interest,
Nannie?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you presently. It's part of the secret."</p>

<p>"Oh, it is. Well then, Helen has dark hair and
blue eyes, a fair skin and little hands and feet. She
is quite small, not much taller than you."</p>

<p>"It all sounds right," said Nan reflectively,
"except the hair. Is she quite old, mother?"</p>

<p>"She is younger than I."</p>

<p>"Oh, then, of course, it is some one else, only my
little lady has a very young smile. Maybe she isn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>so awfully old. Could any one younger than you
have real white hair, mother?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, I have seen persons much younger
whose hair had turned quite gray. Sometimes hair
turns gray quite suddenly from illness or grief or
trouble."</p>

<p>"Could Aunt Helen's hair be gray by this time?"</p>

<p>"It could be, though it was dark when I saw her
last."</p>

<p>Nan pondered upon this and then said: "Well,
anyhow, whoever it was, she told me I was to tell
you that she was my godmother. Did I have two
godmothers?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but I was one. What is all this about?
Whom have you seen, and where did you see her?"</p>

<p>Nan launched forth into her story, her mother
listening so attentively that her sewing lay untouched
in her lap. When Nan had concluded, Mrs. Corner
picked up her work again, but she was so agitated
that she was unable to thread her needle.</p>

<p>"Who was she? Who was she?" queried Nan.</p>

<p>"Your Aunt Helen, without doubt."</p>

<p>"But I thought she was in Europe with my
grandmother."</p>

<p>"So I thought. She evidently came over on some
matter of business, leaving your grandmother
there."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>
<p>"Are you sorry I saw her, mother?" asked Nan,
leaning her elbows on her mother's lap and looking
up into her face. "I told her I ought not to go to
Uplands because you don't like us to. Are you
sorry I went? Are you angry, mother?"</p>

<p>"No, I think I am glad, Nannie."</p>

<p>"Then I am glad, but why didn't she come to see
you when she was so near? Did she say mean
horrid things, too? I can't imagine her doing anything
hateful and mean."</p>

<p>A pained expression passed over Mrs. Corner's
face. "What do you know about that sad time,
Nannie? I have never mentioned it to you
children."</p>

<p>"No, but Unc' Landy told me grandmother said
bitter things. I know you didn't though."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner sighed. "I said one thing, Nannie,
that I have often regretted since, and it is because of
it that your Aunt Helen did not let me know of her
being here. It was in a moment of deep distress.
I was hurt, indignant. I felt that I had been left
desolate with insufficient means to support my
children, and in the only interview I had with your
grandmother I said, 'I hope I shall never again
behold the face of one of the Corner family except
the children of my beloved husband who bear his
name.'"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't blame you," said Nan, taking her
mother's hand between her own. "They were
horribly mean to go off with their money and not
give you a penny. They ought at least to have let
you live in the big house and use the piano."</p>

<p>Her mother smiled. "That is the way you look
at it. Well, we get along somehow without them,
thanks to Aunt Sarah. I am sorry I did not try to
be more friendly to Helen. She was dominated by
her mother and it was no doubt a choice between
her and you children. She was very fond of you as
a baby and she has not forgotten. Her mother's
sadly jealous and envious spirit is what has made
all the trouble."</p>

<p>"I was four years old when they went away,"
said Nan. "I don't remember them at all, though I
remember dear daddy perfectly."</p>

<p>"Let's not talk of it any more," said Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>"Aunt Helen said we might see each other again
some day. Do you suppose they will come back
and will be nice to us and let us go up there sometimes?"</p>

<p>"We cannot say. I do not look into the future to
find such possibilities, Nannie. You must not build
too many air-castles."</p>

<p>"Oh, but I like to," replied Nan. "It's lots of fun
to do it and if they don't amount to anything I've
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>had the fun of the building and nobody's hurt when
they tumble down."</p>

<p>"In that case I suppose it doesn't make much
difference, and when one is naturally a castle-builder
it is hard to give up the habit."</p>

<p>"It isn't as bad as sucking one's fingers as Jean
does, for it doesn't put my mouth out of shape; it
only amuses me and I often forget my castles an
hour after they are ten stories high. I suppose I am
not to tell the children about Aunt Helen."</p>

<p>"I think I wouldn't yet."</p>

<p>"No," said Nan with a mature air. "I think it's
best not. They mightn't understand. Besides, as
she isn't a polywog nor a newly hatched bird, Mary
Lee wouldn't be very much interested in her."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />

<small>A MOTHER'S SECRET</small></h2>


<p>The first days of autumn brought back school
days. Aunt Sarah had gone to visit a nephew in
lower Maryland, leaving behind her mementoes in
the form of the coat of paint for the front fence, a
new cover for the living-room table, and many
stitches put in made-over garments for the children.
She had further dispensed her bounty in a direction
of which the children as yet knew nothing, and it
was Nan who first heard of it from her mother.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's absence was felt in more ways than
one. Mrs. Corner was her favorite niece. A tiny
grave in the old churchyard marked the resting place
of her namesake, Nan's elder sister, who was her
mother's first-born and who lived but three short
months. It may have been that Aunt Sarah's heart
went out more tenderly toward her own sister's
child because of this loss which was so heavy a grief
to them both, but whether it was because of this
bond between them or because they mutually loved
and respected each other, it is true that any sacrifices
which Miss Dent felt she could make she made for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>the Corner family, and when she was with them no
task was too heavy for her, and her wise counsel
and helpful hands were greatly missed by Mrs.
Corner.</p>

<p>It was just after Aunt Sarah's departure, and while
school was still a novelty, that Nan, running in to
tell her mother of the day's doings, noticed that Mrs.
Corner was sewing not for one of the children but
for herself. This was so unusual that Nan remarked
it, and forgetting her school gossip exclaimed,
"Why, mother, you are making a new
frock! Where did you get it?"</p>

<p>Her mother dropped her work with a sigh. Nan
noticed that the dear face was pale and sad. "Aunt
Sarah gave it to me," was the answer. There was
silence for a few moments after this, while Mrs.
Corner went on with her work of measuring off the
black breadths. "I have something to tell you,
little daughter," she then said. "You had a secret
to tell me a little while ago, and now I have one to
tell you." She paused. "It isn't a happy secret,
Nan," she went on, "but as you are my eldest
and my staff to lean upon, you must try to help me
bear it without rebelling."</p>

<p>Nan grew very sober. This was such a melancholy
beginning that she feared what might follow,
but being a young person who never thrust aside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>unpleasant things when she knew they must be met
she said firmly, "Don't bother about me, mother;
I'll be as brave as a lion."</p>

<p>The scissors snipped along the edges of the pattern
while Mrs. Corner bent over her work. Presently
she said, "It is this, Nannie: that I must leave you
for awhile."</p>

<p>All sorts of notions flew to Nan's mind. Was
her mother perhaps going to Europe to hunt up her
Aunt Helen? Was she going to see Cousin Henry
Dent in Maryland? "Oh, mother," she cried, "tell
me quick. Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am going to the Adirondacks, Nannie."</p>

<p>"The Adirondacks?" Nan looked the surprise she
felt. "Why in the world are you going there?
You don't know any one up in those regions, do
you?"</p>

<p>"No, and that makes it harder. I am going for
my health, Nannie."</p>

<p>The blood forsook Nan's cheeks. She felt as if
she were sinking down, down, and it took all her
effort to check a rising sob. All she did, however,
was to hold her nether lip closely between her teeth
and to draw a quivering sigh. Then she gasped
out: "Oh, mother, mother, it doesn't mean&mdash;it
can't mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"It doesn't mean anything very serious&mdash;yet,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>said Mrs. Corner dropping her scissors and sitting
down by Nan's side. "But the doctor says if I go
now the tendency will probably be overcome. If I
stay it may mean that the disease will get the better
of me, and dear Aunt Sarah has made it possible for
me to go. Only a few months, Nan, and Aunt
Sarah will come and stay with you while I am away.
Now, I want you to stand by Aunt Sarah. She has
made, and will continue to make every sacrifice for
your mother, and you must make sacrifices for her."</p>

<p>"Oh, I will," cried Nan. "I won't touch the
melodeon, and I won't nag the others any more than
I can help. Aunt Sarah is good. Oh, I know she
is so good, but she isn't&mdash;she isn't&mdash;you." This
time the tears would have their way and they began
to course down Nan's cheeks though she sat up
straight and tried to blink them away. "And&mdash;and"&mdash;she
went on, "she doesn't&mdash;it's hard to make
her understand things like it's not always being a
waste of time to do what you like and all that."</p>

<p>"I know, but, dear, remember that persons
are very likely to respond to what you expect of
them, and you will find Aunt Sarah very sympathetic
if you take her the right way."</p>

<p>Nan was not at all sure that she could find that
right way but she did not say so. She only looked
at her toes very mournfully and wondered if it had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>happened to be Aunt Helen instead of great-aunt
Sarah who was to be left in charge whether she
would have minded it so much.</p>

<p>"No mother could have had my interests more at
heart," continued Mrs. Corner. "Think how she
has toiled and sacrificed herself for me, and it is
entirely due to her that I am able to go, for not only
has she provided the money for my journey, an expensive
one, but she has thought of a way to pay
my board while I am away, and it is just here, Nan,
that I shall have to depend upon you to stand by
Aunt Sarah. Cousin Tom Gordon's two boys are
to board here and go to school. They want to prepare
for the University and it seems a godsend that
they are coming this year, for it will make my going
away possible. Of course this is a new element.
Two boys coming into a family will make new conditions
and you must consider that Aunt Sarah is
very unselfishly and devotedly undertaking a greater
responsibility than we have any right to ask of her.
So, Nan, try to play the part of peacemaker always.
Be the sweetener of tart speeches; be the sunshine
that drives away the clouds. Aunt Sarah loves you
and appreciates you, though she has a little crisp way
which your over-sensitiveness finds harsh. Never
mind that. Be patient and wise and sweet, so will
you help your mother and bring her back speedily."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'll try, oh, I'll try," said Nan. This was a secret
indeed. What plans! What changes! "When do
the boys come, and when do you go?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I go next week. Aunt Sarah will try to be here
before I leave and before the boys arrive. They expect
to get here on the fifteenth."</p>

<p>"Such a little while; such a little while." Nan
caught her mother's hand and covered it with
kisses. "And when shall you be back?" she asked.</p>

<p>"That I cannot say. It will depend upon what the
doctors say."</p>

<p>Nan sat holding her mother's hand against her
cheek. It would be their first separation and it would
be a hard one. Every now and then the tears
gushed to her eyes, though she tried to force them
back. "Are you going to tell the others why you
are going?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No," returned Mrs. Corner slowly. "I think
we will not tell them just why." That <i>we</i> gave Nan
a sense of partnership in these schemes. It elevated
her to a place beside her mother and Aunt Sarah.
She was their confidante and it behooved her to adjust
her shoulder to a certain burden of responsibility.</p>

<p>"Tell me about the boys," she said. "Are they
nice boys?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<p>"I hope so. If they are not you must try to
make them so. Their names are Randolph and
Ashby. Randolph is a year older than you and
Ashby a year younger."</p>

<p>"Where will they sleep?" asked Nan, coming
down to practical things.</p>

<p>"They can have the room Aunt Sarah always
occupies and she can sleep in my room with Jean
and Jack."</p>

<p>"Will she like that? Couldn't Mary Lee and I
go into your room and let the boys have ours?
Your room is so big and with two double beds in it
we could do very well. Aunt Sarah always likes
that southwest room and it would be warmer in
winter."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner looked pleased at this evidence of
consideration. "I am sure that would be a much
more comfortable plan for all but you and Mary
Lee. It would be some trouble to move all your
belongings. I thought the other way would be
more convenient; still, if you don't mind&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, no, we won't let ourselves mind," said
Nan; then, a little shamefacedly, "besides, it would
seem more like being near you to sleep in your
bed."</p>

<p>Her mother gave the hand that held hers a little
squeeze. "Now, I must go on with my work,"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>she said. "I shall have to get this done before I
go."</p>

<p>"Can't I help?" asked Nan eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not on this, I'm afraid."</p>

<p>"Then I'll do the other things that you do. I'll
go see if Mitty has everything out for supper." She
picked up the key basket but paused before leaving
the room. "May I tell Mary Lee and the twins
about the boys coming and your going if I don't tell
why?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I shall be glad if you would." And Nan
flew to assume the important office of giving information
which would cause a sensation.</p>

<p>She found Mary Lee placidly nursing a decrepit
duck which had fallen into the slop barrel, showing
in her pursuit of dainties an eagerness which did not
accord with her age. Having been rescued and well
washed by Mary Lee, she was now lying in that
young person's lap rolled in an old bit of horse
blanket, her restless eyes alone giving evidence of
her uncurbed ambition.</p>

<p>"Come here, Mary Lee, I have a mighty big
piece of news to tell you," cried Nan. "I'm going
to tell you first."</p>

<p>"You come here," said Mary Lee. "I can't put
the duck down till she gets dry."</p>

<p>"How ridiculous! As if a duck cared whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>she was wet or dry," said Nan, going up and giving
the duck a friendly poke, eliciting a remonstrative
"Quack!"</p>

<p>"You'd care if you had fallen into a slop barrel
and had to be dipped out in a bucket and lathered
all over and rinsed off," said Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't be so foolish as to fall into a slop
barrel in the first place. Ducks are such greedy
things. I don't see how she got up there."</p>

<p>"She walked up a board like anybody," returned
Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"Well, anywhere that she could swim would
have done for her bath. It was silly to go through
all that fuss of bathing her when she's just a duck
that loves water like any other duck."</p>

<p>"What is your news?" asked Mary Lee, changing
the subject. "I don't believe it's anything much.
You always get so excited over trifles."</p>

<p>"I reckon you won't call this a trifle," replied
Nan, "when I tell you that mother is going away
for weeks and that Aunt Sarah is coming back to
look after us, and that Randolph and Ashby Gordon
are coming here to board all winter. I should think
that was something to get excited over," she said
triumphantly.</p>

<p>Mary Lee stared. "You're making it all up just
to fool me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm not, either. What in the world would I
want to do that for? It's true, every word of it.
You can ask mother if it isn't."</p>

<p>"What's she going for?" asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"Oh, just because. Grown people have their
reasons for doing things and we can't always be
told them," replied Nan, with, it must be said,
rather a condescending air.</p>

<p>"Do you know why?" asked her sister, determined
upon getting to the heart of the matter.</p>

<p>"Maybe I do, and maybe I don't."</p>

<p>"If you do, I think you are downright mean not
to tell me. I'm 'most as old as you, and she's my
mother as much as she is yours."</p>

<p>These latter facts Nan could not deny, so she
answered weakly, "Well, anyhow, I shan't
tell."</p>

<p>Mary Lee was slow to wrath, but once aroused
she did not hesitate to speak her worst. She deposited
her roll of horse blanket upon the ground
and the duck with satisfied quacks waddled forth
from the encumbering folds, glad of her freedom.
"You are altogether too high and mighty, Nancy
Weston Corner," said Mary Lee, quite outraged by
Nan's refusal. "You're a scurvy old pullet, so
there!"</p>

<p>"I like your way of calling names," returned Nan
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>contemptuously. "I should think any one could
tell that you had been near a slop barrel; you talk
like it."</p>

<p>Mary Lee did not wait for further words, but fled
to her mother, Nan following, taking the shorter
way and reaching her mother first. "I tried to tell
Mary Lee without saying why," she began breathlessly,
"and she called me a horrid name, so I don't
know how it will turn out."</p>

<p>"I think we shall have to tell her," said Mrs.
Corner. "I did not realize that it might be difficult
for you."</p>

<p>"She's coming now," said Nan.</p>

<p>Mary Lee's footsteps were hastily approaching.
She burst into the room with, "Mother, is it true
that you are going away?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear child."</p>

<p>"What for? Nan was so mean and wouldn't
tell me."</p>

<p>"I didn't give Nan permission to tell you why I
was going."</p>

<p>"She needn't have been so disagreeable about it
though," said Mary Lee. "Why didn't she say that
you told her not to tell?"</p>

<p>"You didn't give me a chance," put in Nan.
"You called me a scurvy old pullet before I could
explain."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>
<p>"What a name, Mary Lee," said Mrs. Corner
reprovingly. "Where did you hear it?"</p>

<p>"Phil says it."</p>

<p>"Don't say it again. If you lose your temper like
that and cannot bridle your tongue, I am afraid your
mother will have many sorry moments while she is
away trying to regain her health."</p>

<p>In an instant Mary Lee was on her knees by her
mother's side. "Are you ill, mother?" she asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not very, but I may be if I do not have a change
of climate, so I am going to take a trip. I have
hardly left this place for eight years and more. I
shall come back trig as a trivet, Mary Lee, so don't
be troubled about me."</p>

<p>Nan left her mother to explain matters further and
sought the twins who were amicably swinging
under a big tree. As she unfolded her news to
them the point which at first seemed to be most
important was the coming of the two boys. Jack
objected to their arrival, Jean welcomed it, and
straightway they began a discussion in the midst of
which Nan left them. Her brain was buzzing with
the many thoughts which her interview with her
mother suggested. She determined to be zealous in
good works, and immediately hunted up Mitty that
she might see that all was going well in the kitchen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>
<p>Mitty had not much respect for one younger than
herself and paid no attention when Nan entered, but
kept on singing in a high shrill key:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whe-e-en Eve eat de apple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whe-e-e-en Eve eat de apple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whe-en Eve eat de apple,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, what a try-y-in' time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Mitty, have you everything out for supper?"
asked Nan with her mother's manner.</p>

<p>Mitty rolled her eyes in Nan's direction, but
vouchsafed no reply, continuing to sing in a little
higher key:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When she-e gabe de co' to Adam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whe-en she gabe de co' to Adam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whe-e-en she gabe de co' to Adam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord, what a try-y-yin' time."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"I want to know," repeated Nan severely, "if
you have everything out for supper?"</p>

<p>"I has what I has," returned Mitty, breaking some
splinters of wood across her knee.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd answer me properly," said Nan,
impatiently.</p>

<p>"Yuh ain' de lady ob de house," returned Mitty,
provokingly. "Yuh ain' but jest a little peepin'
chick. Yuh ain' even fryin' size yet."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>
<p>"I think when mother sends me with a message,
it is your place to answer me," said Nan with her
head in the air. "I will see if Unc' Landy can get
you to tell me what mother wants to know." And
she stalked out.</p>

<p>As Unc' Landy was Mitty's grandfather, and the
only being of whom she stood in awe, this had its
effect. "I tell yuh, Miss Nan, 'deed an' 'deed I
will," cried Mitty, running after her and hastily
enumerating the necessary articles to be given out
from the pantry. "'Tain' no buttah, 'tain' no
sugah, jest a little bit o' co'n meal. Oh, Miss Nan!"</p>

<p>But Nan had passed beyond hearing and was
resolutely turning her steps toward Unc' Landy's
quarters, a comfortable brick cabin which stood
about fifty yards from the house. The old man
was sitting before its door industriously mending a
hoe-handle. It was not often that Nan complained
of Mitty, for she, too, well knew the effect of such
a course. Upon this occasion, however, she felt
that her future authority depended upon establishing
present relations and that it would never do to
let Mitty know she had worsted the eldest daughter
of the house. "Unc' Landy, I wish you'd speak
to Mitty," said Nan. "She wouldn't tell me what
to give out for supper and mother gave me the keys
to attend to it for her; she's busy sewing."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>
<p>Unc' Landy seized the hoe-handle upon which he
was at work, and made an energetic progress toward
the kitchen, catching the unlucky Mitty as
she was about to flee. Brandishing his hoe-handle,
he threateningly cried: "Wha' yo' mannahs? I
teach yuh show yo' sassy ways to one of de
fambly!"</p>

<p>Up went Mitty's arm to defend herself from the
impending blow while she whimpered forth: "I
done say 'tain' no buttah; 'tain' no sugah; the's a
little bit o' meal; an' Miss Nan ain' hyah me."</p>

<p>"Ef I bus' yo' haid open den mebbe she kin hyah
yuh nex' time," said Unc' Landy catching the girl's
shoulder and beginning to bang her head against the
door.</p>

<p>But here Nan, feeling that Mitty was scared into
good behavior interfered. "That will do, Unc'
Landy. If she told me, it is all right."</p>

<p>"She gwine speak loudah an' quickah nex' time,"
said Unc' Landy, shaking his hoe-handle at Mitty.
"Yuh tell Miss Nan what she ast yuh, er I'll fetch
Mr. Hoe ober hyah agin an' try both ends, so yuh
see which yuh lak bes'." And he went off muttering
about "dese yer no 'count young niggahs
what so busy tryin' to be sma't dey ain' no time to
larn sense."</p>

<p>The thoroughly humbled Mitty meekly answered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>all Nan's questions and Nan felt that she was fortified
with authority for some time to come.</p>

<p>Nan was always shocked and repelled by Unc'
Landy's methods, and only in extreme cases was she
willing to appeal to him. Such appeals, sometimes
bringing swifter and more extreme punishment, so
affected Nan as to make her avoid Unc' Landy for
days. He was always so very tender and courteous
to every member of the "fambly" that it
seemed almost incredible that he should be so
merciless to one of his own flesh and blood, but
such was a common attitude of the older negroes
toward the younger ones, and his was not an unusual
case. When Mrs. Corner was on hand she
never permitted the old man to exercise his rights
toward Mitty, but once or twice when the girl had
overstepped bounds in his presence, he had meted
out punishment to her later on, so she feared him
while she respected him, praising him lavishly to
her boon companions.</p>

<p>"Gran'daddy got a pow'ful long ahm," she
would say, "an' man, I say he swif' an' strong, mos'
lak angel Gabr'el wid he swo'd an' trumpet. I mos'
as feared o' gran'daddy as I is o' angel Gabr'el. Ef
gran'daddy call me an' angel Gabr'el blow he
trumpet at de same time I don' know which I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>bleedged to min'. I specs I run a bilin' to
gran'daddy fust."</p>

<p>Having established her position in the kitchen,
Nan returned to her mother. Every moment
seemed precious now, and that night after Mary
Lee was asleep, Nan crept softly from her bed and
laid herself down by her mother whose arms
clasped her close, but who did not allow her to
remain. "It is not well for you to sleep with me,
dear," she said. "It will be better for us both if
you go back to your own room." Nan obeyed, but
it was an anxious hour that she spent before sleep
visited her. The night hours brought her many
forebodings, and she felt that her young spirit was
stretching beyond the limits of childhood toward
that larger and less happy region of womanhood.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />

<small>HOUSEWIFELY CARES</small></h2>


<p>The day for Mrs. Corner's departure came around
all too soon. Aunt Sarah was to have arrived the
evening before, but up to the last moment she had
not come, and Mrs. Corner felt that she could not
wait since all her arrangements were made. "I am
positive she will be here to-day," she told Nan,
"probably by the noon train, and the boys will not
come till to-morrow, so you will have no trouble,
even if Aunt Sarah should not come till night."</p>

<p>There were many tears and embraces at the last
moment. Even Jean's placidity was disturbed and
when the train which held her mother, moved out
of sight, she flung herself in Nan's arms sobbing,
"Oh, I didn't want her to go, I didn't."</p>

<p>Jack rubbed her eyes with none too clean fists and
reiterated: "I promised I'd be good; I promised
I'd be good." As for Mary Lee she slipped an arm
around her elder sister, but "Oh, Nan! Oh, Nan!"
was all she could say. Nan herself bravely kept
back the tears but her feeling of helplessness and
desolation was almost more than she could bear.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>Mother, who had never left them for so much as a
night, gone far away where they could not and
should not reach her. No one to advise, to comfort,
to sympathize. No one to confide in. It was all
blackness and darkness without that blessed mother.</p>

<p>Four very sober children returned to the house to
eat their dinner alone. Even the importance of sitting
at the head of the table brought no joy to Nan,
and the fact that Phil's mother had sent them over a
dish of frozen custard brought none of them any
great enjoyment.</p>

<p>Mitty had taken advantage of the occasion to announce
that she was going to a "fessible." She informed
Nan that she had asked Mrs. Corner's consent
weeks before and had been told that when the
Sons and Daughters of Moses and Aaron had their
"fessible" she could go. There was really nothing
to say, and Mitty, adorned in a rattling, stiffly
starched petticoat over which as stiffly a starched
pink lawn stood out magnificently, started forth,
bearing her purple parasol and wearing her brilliant
yellow hat trimmed with blue roses.</p>

<p>"She certainly is a sight," remarked Mary Lee,
watching Mitty's exit. "Wouldn't her feathers
drop if she should get wet? Oh, Nan, I do believe
a thunder-storm is coming up. Look at that black
cloud."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>"Now don't begin to be scary," said Nan, coming
to the window. If there was one thing above another
of which Mary Lee was scared it was a thunder-storm;
it completely demoralized her, and she
would always retire to the darkest corner, crouching
there in dread of each flash of lightning and clap of
thunder. Nan scanned the sky and then said calmly,
"Well, I think it is very likely we will have a
shower; we generally do when the Sons and Daughters
have their festival."</p>

<p>It had been a sultry day, and the low-hanging
clouds began to increase in mass, showing jagged
edges, and following one another up the sky, black,
threatening, rolling forms. In the course of half an
hour, the first peal of distant thunder came to their
ears and Mary Lee began to tremble. "It seems a
thousand times worse when mother isn't here,"
she complained. "It seems dreadful for us four
children to be here all alone. Suppose the lightning
should strike the house."</p>

<p>"Then mother would be safe," said Nan, exultantly.</p>

<p>"But it wouldn't do her any good if we should
all be killed," Mary Lee returned lugubriously.</p>

<p>"Suppose it should strike the train mother is
in?" said Jean in a frightened tone.</p>

<p>"Oh, it couldn't," Nan reassured her. "It goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>so fast that it would get beyond the storm. The
sun is probably shining bright where mother is by
this time."</p>

<p>This was more comforting; nevertheless Mary
Lee's fears increased in proportion to the loudness
of the thunderclaps. "I'm sure we are not safe
here," she declared. "It is getting worse and
worse, Nan." A terrific crash which seemed to come
from directly overhead gave proof to the truth of
her words. Jean clung to her and even Jack looked
scared. Mary Lee cowered down in the corner and
covered her face.</p>

<p>"Come, I'll tell you what we'll do," said Nan,
though by no means unaffrighted herself; "we'll
do what Aunt Sarah's grandmother used to do;
we'll all go up-stairs; it's safer there, and we'll pile
all the pillows on mother's bed&mdash;we'll pull it into
the middle of the room first&mdash;and then we'll all get
on it and say hymns. There isn't any feather-bed
like they used to have, but the pillows will answer
the same purpose. Come, Mary Lee." They
all rushed up-stairs, and, between thunderclaps,
gathered pillows from the different rooms, and then
established themselves upon them in the middle of
the bed.</p>

<p>"Aunt Sarah said they never used to feel afraid
when their grandmother commenced to say the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>hymns, and she taught me the best one to say. Keep
still, Jack, and I'll say it." A second violent crash of
thunder drowned her words and Mary Lee threw
herself prone upon her face, calling out: "Put some
pillows over me so I can't see nor hear."</p>

<p>"We can't; we're sitting on them," returned
Nan. "You are perfectly safe, Mary Lee. Now
listen and you won't mind the thunder." And she
began the fine old hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God moves in a mysterious way<br /></span>
<span class="i3">His wonders to perform,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">He plants His footsteps on the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And rides upon the storm."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"It scares me for Him to ride upon the storm,"
faltered Jean.</p>

<p>"But you know if He is in the storm, He is right
here to take care of us," said Nan, reassuringly.
Jean was satisfied. Even Mary Lee raised her head
when Nan had finished the hymn. "Now it is your
turn," said Nan. "What will you say, Mary Lee?"</p>

<p>"I think I like 'Jesus, Lover of My Soul,' but I
don't know it very well. Do you dare get down
and bring me my hymnal, Nan? I wouldn't ask
you only I could no more leave this spot than fly."</p>

<p>"I don't mind, I'm sure," responded Nan readily.
"I think the worst is over anyhow." But she had
scarcely returned with the book when another loud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>peal sent her scrambling to her nest in the pillows
and it was some moments before Mary Lee could
gain courage to sit up and repeat the hymn, which
she could not do without frequent peepings at the
page before her.</p>

<p>"Now Jack, it's your turn," Nan prompted.</p>

<p>Jack was always ready and she began and said
through without faltering the hymn beginning:
"Dear Jesus ever at my side." There was a most
uplifted and saintlike expression on the child's face
as, with clasped hands, she repeated the closing lines:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But when I sleep, Thou sleepest not,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">But watchest patiently."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One would have supposed Jack to be a most lovely
and angelic person, and, in truth, for the time being,
she was angelic.</p>

<p>Jean's turn came last. "I can't fink of anyfing
but 'Jesus, tender Shepherd, Hear Me,' and it isn't
bedtime yet," she said.</p>

<p>"Never mind if it isn't," said Nan; "it is quite
dark and that will do very nicely." So Jean added
her hymn while the storm still raged. However,
they were all comforted, and finding that the plan of
Aunt Sarah's grandmother worked so well, Nan proposed
that they should not stop but should take
another round of hymns.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>
<p>"It would be nicer to sing them I think," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"So it would," the others agreed, "and then nobody
would have to remember all, for, if one should
forget the hymnal will be right here."</p>

<p>"Let's sing 'Now the day is over,'" said Jack.</p>

<p>"But it isn't over," objected the literal Jean.
However as this was a general favorite, they sang it
through and by that time the storm was passing
over and they felt they could safely leave the feather
pillows.</p>

<p>"It was a splendid plan," declared Mary Lee.
"Once or twice I almost forgot to be afraid, though
I do wish Unc' Landy could have been somewhere
in the house."</p>

<p>"I don't know how he could have helped matters,"
returned Nan, "though I shouldn't have
minded his being on hand. I don't believe he has
gone to the festival and very likely has been out in
all the storm stopping leaks in the barn; it's what he
generally does. Gracious! what's that?"</p>

<p>A thundering knock at the door stopped them in
their work of returning the pillows to their places.
"Who can it be?" said Nan.</p>

<p>"Maybe it's some one from Cousin Mag Lewis's
to see if we are all right," said Mary Lee. "I
shouldn't wonder if it were Phil."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, you go see."</p>

<p>Mary Lee ran down-stairs to the door. It was
still raining a little as the puddles in the front walk
showed. The vines were dripping and the flowers
hung heavy heads. Mary Lee did not notice these
things, however, for two strange lads stood before
her. She at once surmised who they were. "Come
right in," she said. "Just put your umbrellas in
that corner of the porch. I'll tell Nan you are
here."</p>

<p>"We are Randolph and Ashby Gordon," said the
boys.</p>

<p>"I know," returned Mary Lee, and sped up the
stairs leaving the boys to deposit their wet umbrellas
on the porch. "Nan, Nan," called the girl, "they've
come, and Aunt Sarah isn't here."</p>

<p>"Who has come?" Nan questioned from the top
of the steps.</p>

<p>"The boys, our cousins, Randolph and Ashby.
They are at the front door."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" exclaimed Nan. "What did you
say to them, Mary Lee?"</p>

<p>"I didn't say anything except to tell them where
to put their umbrellas. Come right down, please,
Nan."</p>

<p>"Their bed isn't made or anything," said Nan,
pausing to look across at the open doorway which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>disclosed a room not yet in good order. "I'll have
to explain, I suppose."</p>

<p>She went sedately down-stairs to find the two
boys standing in the front hall. "Oh, how do you
do?" she began. "We didn't expect you to-day"&mdash;and
then feeling that this was scarcely a welcoming
speech, she hesitated, blushing at not being
ready for the occasion.</p>

<p>"I know," said the elder boy, "and we must
apologize for being ahead of time, but we found that
we could get here to-day and have company all the
way. A friend of father's, one of the professors at
the University, was coming, and he insisted upon
our taking the same train. I hope it doesn't make
any difference to you."</p>

<p>"No," Nan faltered, "only Aunt Sarah hasn't
come yet and your room isn't quite ready."</p>

<p>"Oh, no matter," returned the boy, courteously
enough, but rather distantly.</p>

<p>"You see, mother went away only this morning,"
Nan continued her explanations, "and Mitty, our
girl, has gone out, but if you will just walk into the
living-room and make yourselves at home, I can soon
get everything in order. I'm Nan, you know. It
was Mary Lee who opened the door and the twins
are up-stairs. We had a heavy storm, didn't we?"</p>

<p>"We certainly did," replied Randolph, following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>her into the room. His brother silently entered
with him.</p>

<p>"Please make yourselves at home," repeated
Nan.</p>

<p>Having established her guests, she flew up-stairs.
"They're here sure enough," she said. "You all
will have to help me get the room ready; fortunately
it has been swept. Jean, get some clean towels and
the piece of soap from mother's room. I suppose
we shall have to give them soap. Jack, I wish you
would get some water. No, you'd better not," she
called. But Jack, finding a chance to help and
rather liking the task imposed upon her, was already
half way down-stairs. With Mary Lee's assistance,
the bed was made and the room was soon tidy.
Then Nan returned below stairs to decide what to
have for supper. She would put the best foot forward,
and, though she was racking her brains for a
proper bill of fare, she would not show her anxiety.
Her own efforts in the way of cooking had been
limited, for her mother had always been there to
take the weight of responsibility. She could make
tea, but perhaps the boys didn't drink it; she would
find out. She would have to attempt either biscuits
or batter bread, for, of course, cold bread was out of
the question. There was no cold meat. She would
fry some bacon. Bacon and eggs would do nicely.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>She would set Mary Lee to paring and cutting up
some peaches. There could be sliced tomatoes, too.
If the bread question could be settled, they would
do very well. She would bake some potatoes in
case her bread was a failure. She sent Jean to find
Mary Lee and tell her to come to the kitchen and
then she set to work.</p>

<p>"They're just like company," was the remark
with which she greeted Mary Lee. "They don't
act a bit as if they belonged to us. The little one,
Ashby, hardly opened his lips, and the other one was
polite enough but acted as if we weren't kinsfolk
at all, but just strangers who were going to take
them to board. I'm going to have bacon and eggs
for supper. I wish you'd see if Unc' Landy is
around anywhere; he can cut the bacon for us. I'm
afraid I could not do it well, and I shall have to try
some biscuits. I've made the fire, Mary Lee, and I
wish you'd put a few potatoes in the oven. Where's
Jack? There isn't a speck of cake in the house
and they look as though they were used to having
it."</p>

<p>"How can Jack do anything about it?" inquired
Mary Lee, rolling the potatoes into a pan preparatory
to washing them.</p>

<p>"I'm going to send her over to Cousin Mag's to
see if she has any. I'd better write a note for Jack
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>gets things mixed sometimes." She ran to her room
and scribbled a note to Mrs. Lewis, as the two
families often accommodated one another in this
way. Having despatched Jack upon her errand,
Nan turned her attention again to the supper. Unc'
Landy had evidently been storm-stayed somewhere
and had not yet returned, so the bacon was cut
rather clumsily and set over the fire to sizzle. To
Mary Lee was given the responsibility of preparing
the peaches and setting the table. Nan suggested
that she put on the very best of everything.</p>

<p>"Oh, need we do that?" she said. "We'll have
to wash them up afterward, you know, for Mitty
will not be here to do it, and it would be awful if
we were to break anything."</p>

<p>"Never mind," returned Nan, "I'll take the risk.
We must show them that we have nice silver and
china. Go on and do as I say, Mary Lee."</p>

<p>Mary Lee obeyed and Nan turned to her other
tasks. "I wonder how long it takes bacon to
cook," she said to herself, "and I wonder how
much flour I shall need for the biscuits. I'll have to
guess at it. Dear me, how does any one ever learn
all those things?" She carefully sifted her flour
and then measured out her baking powder accurately.
As she was hesitating as to the amount of
lard required, she realized that the kitchen was full
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>of smoke from burning bacon, and, hurrying to the
stove, she discovered that every slice was hard and
black.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," she sighed, "it's ruined, and I'll have
to cut more; it's such a trouble, too. I'll finish the
biscuits first, for I see the bacon will cook while
they are baking." The interruption made her forget
the salt for her biscuits, and she set rather a rough,
ragged looking panful in the oven.</p>

<p>The next lot of bacon was cooked more successfully,
though some slices were thick at one end and
thin at the other. Some were short, some were
long, quite unlike the neat curly bits which usually
appeared upon the table. Mary Lee came in as she
was concluding her tasks and her comments upon
the looks of the dish did not reassure Nan.</p>

<p>However, she rose to the occasion. "They won't
show when I've covered them with the fried eggs,"
she declared. "Dear me, Mary Lee, I'll never lift
the eggs without breaking them. I'll have to let
them cook more, I reckon. Hand me the cake-turner,
please; maybe I can do better with that, and
won't you look at the biscuits? They ought to be
done by this time."</p>

<p>Mary Lee announced that they looked done.</p>

<p>"Try the potatoes."</p>

<p>A squeal from Mary Lee followed this operation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>for she squeezed one potato too hard and it burst
with a pop, burning her thumb.</p>

<p>Nan dressed the burn with a plaster of baking
soda and dished up the potatoes herself. "Where's
Jean?" she asked.</p>

<p>"She put on her best frock and is in the living-room
entertaining the gentlemen," returned Mary
Lee. "It's time Jack came back, don't you think,
Nan?"</p>

<p>"High time," returned Nan, carefully transferring
the rest of the eggs from pan to dish. "I've only
broken one, Mary Lee, and the bacon is quite
covered. Everything is nearly ready, but, oh, dear,
how does any one ever do it quickly and easily?
It is impossible to keep your mind on bacon and
eggs and biscuits and potatoes all at once, and how
any one remembers more than that is beyond me.
There, we came near forgetting the peaches. Get
them out of the pantry, and bring some fine sugar
to put over them."</p>

<p>"It's getting pretty late," remarked Mary Lee,
looking down the street, "but here comes Jack at
last."</p>

<p>"I know it's late and I expect those boys are
starved, but I can't help it; I've done my best."</p>

<p>"I should think you had," said Mary Lee; "you
oughtn't to have had so much."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm sorry I had potatoes, for they made you
burn yourself. Well, Jack," as that young person
entered the kitchen mud-stained and tearful, "what
have you been doing? What is the matter?"</p>

<p>Jack held out a flattened parcel. "I fell down,"
she sobbed, "and I fell plumb on the cake."</p>

<p>"Goodness!" cried Nan. "Do see, Mary Lee, if
it's fit to eat. I can't, for my hands are all peach
juice from cutting up the peaches. Did you hurt
yourself, Jack?"</p>

<p>"I hurt my feelings awfully, 'cause I spoiled the
cake."</p>

<p>Mary Lee anxiously examined the contents of the
parcel. The cake, fortunately, had been sent on a
tin plate, which saved it from utter destruction.
"It is quite good in places," she declared. "We'll
put the mashed pieces underneath."</p>

<p>Nan laughed in spite of fatigue and anxiety.
"Then it will match the dish of bacon," she said.
"Never mind, Jack, you did your best and we are
much obliged to you; the cake will taste good and
we girls can eat the flat pieces. Now, are we all
ready?"</p>

<p>"I think so," said Mary Lee, nursing her injured
thumb. And the flushed and anxious housekeeper
arranged her dishes upon the carefully set table.</p>

<p>"It looks beautiful," said Jack.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<p>"I'm glad you thought of the flowers for the
middle of the table, Mary Lee," remarked Nan, who
was critically examining her board. "Yes, I think
it looks very well. Now, I'll go and call them."</p>

<p>The meal went off fairly well in spite of the
chunks of bacon and the mashed cake. To be sure,
it was rather a solemn affair. Conversation flagged,
for both boys and girls felt ill at ease. Nan was
covered with confusion when she tasted her biscuits,
and was obliged to excuse herself when she
suddenly remembered the tomatoes which she had
sliced and placed on the ice and when she caught
an odor of burning bread. She rescued the last pan
of biscuits just in time, only one or two having
burned at the bottom.</p>

<p>After supper there was the task of clearing away,
and when this was over and the last dish safely put
away, it was a tired Nan who sent her sisters off to
bed and sat waiting for the boys who had gone out
to have a look at the town. There was no hope of
seeing Aunt Sarah that night, for the last train was
in, and Nan curled herself up in her mother's big chair
by the window, feeling quite desperate when she
thought of breakfast without the help of either Mitty
or Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>After the boys had returned and Nan was at last
lying by Mary Lee, the very thought of the dear absent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>one sent the tears coursing down her cheeks,
so that the pillow her mother's head had so often
pressed was wet before the tired child fell asleep.
It began to rain again, and all through the night the
sound of the pattering drops made Nan dream that
her mother was weeping, and longing for home and
children.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />

<small>CONCERNING JACK</small></h2>


<p>The consciousness of her responsibilities made
Nan awaken with a start quite early in the morning.
After her festivities, Mitty could not be expected to
appear before nine o'clock, consequently, the matter
of breakfast depended entirely upon Nan. She was
sufficiently rested after her night's sleep to look upon
the day's prospects with more calmness than had
seemed possible the night before. The storm had
passed; all the fears and dreams vanished in the
sunshine. The whole world appeared fairer. The
heavy rain had washed the dust from the leaves;
the grass sprang up in livelier green; the morning-glories
over the porch were fresh and beautiful; the
very earth looked refreshed. Birds were singing in
the bushes; a rooster was lustily crowing from a
fence rail.</p>

<p>"It has cleared off beautifully," said Nan as she
opened the kitchen door to look out. "Good
morning, Lady Gray," she greeted the big cat
which came purring to rub against her. "I hope
my stormy time is over, too," she went on. "It
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>certainly was a gray day yesterday, but to-day
Aunt Sarah will surely come and Mitty will be
back, so there is only breakfast to trouble me. I
haven't the least idea what I ought to have, or, I
should say, what I can have. I thought Aunt Sarah
would be here to decide all such things. I can't
have bacon and eggs again! Unc' Landy! Ah,
Unc' Landy!" she called to the old man who was
just issuing from his cabin.</p>

<p>He came toward her. "Mawnin,' miss," he said,
taking off his battered hat with a bow. "Fine
day arter de rain."</p>

<p>"It is indeed. Unc' Landy, I want you to cut
some slices of ham for me."</p>

<p>"Yass, miss. Whar dat Mitty?"</p>

<p>"Now you know Mitty won't get back till nine
o'clock. She never does after a festival or a picnic
or a parlor social, as she calls it. She is too sleepy
after staying up half the night."</p>

<p>"Po' miserble sinnah," grumbled Unc' Landy.
"Bad man git her suah ef her foots keep on
a-twitchen' when de banjo play."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mitty is all right," returned Nan smiling.
"You are too hard on her, Unc' Landy."</p>

<p>"'Tain' no use talkin' to dese yer light-haided
young uns," he replied. "Yuh jest bleedged to
beat erligion inter 'em. Dey foots is on de broad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>road to destruction, and yuh bleedged to drive 'em
back wid er stick, jest lak a sheep er a heifer er a
pig when dey gits outer de parf. How much ham
yuh reckon yuh wants, honey?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a couple of slices. I suppose you can tell
how long to cook it. I had an awful time with
my supper last night, and it wasn't very good after
all. I forgot to put salt in the biscuits and the
bacon was chunky."</p>

<p>"Whafo' yuh mek any fuss jest fo' yuh-alls?"
said Unc' Landy. "Why yuh don' jest picnic till
yo' Aunt Sarah come? 'Tain' no diffunce ef yuh
chilluns ain' got a comp'ny brekfus."</p>

<p>"But it is a difference when we have two
strangers."</p>

<p>"Strangers? Who dey?" Unc' Landy looked
greatly surprised.</p>

<p>"The Gordon boys, Randolph and Ashby.
They were to have come to-day, you know, but
they got here yesterday instead."</p>

<p>"Law, honey, is dat so? An' de ole man ain' on
han' to he'p yuh-alls out when dat fool chile Mitty
away. Now, ain' dat scan'lous fo' Unc' Landy git
ketched in de rain an' not git home in time fo' suppah?
I clar it righ down owdacious. Nemmine,
don' yuh werry, chile, I fix yo' brekfus. What
yuh reckon yuh have?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>
<p>"Ham; you know I asked you to cut it."</p>

<p>"Brile ham. Yes'm, and a pone, aig pone.
How dat do?"</p>

<p>"I used all the eggs last night."</p>

<p>"Dey mo' in de hen-house, I reckon. I git 'em.
Coffee, yuh bleedged ter have a good cup of coffee."</p>

<p>"Well, yes, I suppose Randolph drinks it and
maybe Ashby does. We'll have it, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Might fry some taters, er tomats," suggested
Unc' Landy.</p>

<p>"Yes, they would be good."</p>

<p>"Den go 'long an' set de table, honey, whilst I
git de aigs, an' den' yuh come tell ole Landy whar
things is an' he git yo' brekfus. He cook, yass 'm,
dat he kin. He domeskit, Landy are." And chuckling
at this self praise the old man jogged down to
the hen-house while Nan flew to set the table,
greatly relieved at having so capable an assistant.</p>

<p>The breakfast turned out to be all it should. The
ham was cooked to a turn; the egg pone, light and
puffy, came to the table hot and delicious; the coffee
was perfect; the tomatoes fried brown and surrounded
by a tempting gravy. Nan tried to make
conversation and her sisters ably assisted her, but
the boys were not very responsive, though Nan
concluded it was shyness and not pride which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>prevented them from being more talkative. They
escaped as soon as the meal was over and Nan
drew a sigh of relief. "They certainly aren't very
good company," she remarked. "Jean seems the
only one they will have anything to say to."</p>

<p>"You forget she dressed up in her best and
entertained them yesterday," said Mary Lee, laughing.
"What did you talk about, kitten?"</p>

<p>"Oh, fings to eat, and&mdash;and horses and&mdash;dogs."</p>

<p>"No wonder then they found something to say,"
laughed Nan. "Now run along and get ready for
school. Mary Lee will start later and I may not get
there at all."</p>

<p>"There isn't going to be any school to-day," returned
Jean.</p>

<p>"Why not? Who said so?"</p>

<p>"Jack said so."</p>

<p>"How did she find out?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. She said this morning when we
were getting dressed that there wasn't going to be
any school to-day."</p>

<p>"It isn't a holiday. I'd like to know why," said
Nan reflectively. "Are you sure, Jean?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I'm sure. I asked Jack twice and both
times she said: 'There isn't going to be any
school.'"</p>

<p>"To be sure we weren't there yesterday," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>Nan, "and she probably heard from some one over
at Cousin Mag's. Where is Jack?"</p>

<p>"I don't know."</p>

<p>"Go find her, there's a good girl."</p>

<p>Jean went out. She saw nothing of her twin,
so she sought the dog who would be a willing and
able help in finding Jack.</p>

<p>As she stood at the gate, looking up and down
the street, the two boys came out. "What are you
looking for?" asked Randolph.</p>

<p>"I'm looking for Trouble," she replied.</p>

<p>The boy gave a short laugh. "You'll find it soon
enough if you look for it," he said, passing on and
leaving Jean much puzzled by his remark. Finding
neither Jack nor Trouble in this direction, she sought
Unc' Landy and Trouble was discovered gnawing a
ham bone by the old man's cabin door. "Come,
Trouble, find Jack," called Jean.</p>

<p>The dog dropped his bone, cocked his head to one
side, flopped an ear over one eye and looked at her
brightly.</p>

<p>"Find Jack. Come, where's Jack?" repeated
Jean. Then Trouble understood, and set off down
the street, Jean following.</p>

<p>Just before the schoolhouse was reached, Jack
was discovered sitting on the steps of a vacant
house. She had settled herself there before any of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>the school children came that way. There were too
many interesting things occurring for Jack to wish to
waste her time at school, and she had argued out a
plan of proceeding which ought to satisfy everybody,
she reflected. There could be no school without
scholars and she would see to it that there were no
scholars. As each child came along she promptly
called out: "There isn't going to be any school to-day."
She felt that this was strict truth. The first
arrivals turned back all too readily and repeated
Jack's words to the others they met, so that within
the schoolroom the teacher wondered and waited
till ten o'clock. By that time Jack, feeling that the
day was saved, left the steps where she had been
sitting and went to the station to wait the first train
in from Washington.</p>

<p>Before this, however, Trouble had discovered her
to Jean in his most polite manner. "Nan wants
you, Jack," announced Jean, running up.</p>

<p>"I don't care. She's not my mother," returned
Jack.</p>

<p>"You'd better come."</p>

<p>"I will when I'm ready."</p>

<p>"I'm going straight home to tell her."</p>

<p>"I don't care."</p>

<p>"I don't see what you want to sit here for all by
yourself."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>
<p>"Because I choose."</p>

<p>In this mood Jack was not companionable, as Jean
knew to her sorrow, and so, after a look of virtuous
reproach at her sister, and a lifting of her head in
scorn, she walked off with switching skirts, pounding
down her heels very hard and calling back: "I'll
tell Aunt Sarah too."</p>

<p>"She hasn't come yet," called Jack in return.</p>

<p>"You don't know whether she has or not," came
the reply in fainter tones.</p>

<p>"I do so. The train doesn't get in till eleven.
Ba-ah!" Then Jean indignantly pursued her way
to pour forth her grievance in Nan's ear.</p>

<p>"She was sitting on the steps of the old Southall
house," she reported, "and she wouldn't come
when I said you wanted her. She said 'Ba-ah!' too,
and she told me she'd come when she was ready."</p>

<p>Nan knew Jack's eccentricities of old, and that
she should choose to be sitting on the steps of the
Southall house was not a matter of surprise, though
she wondered why Jack preferred to be there to enjoying
her own home garden on a holiday. But she
did not think it wise to try to force an obedience
which very likely would not be given, so she said:
"Well, never mind, let her stay there if she likes it.
Perhaps she is waiting for some one. Isn't that
Mitty coming? It looks like her yellow hat."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is Mitty," Jean assured her, "but her hat
looks funny and she's got on an old calico wrapper."</p>

<p>Mitty entered rather shamefacedly. She had a
tale of woe to tell. She had been caught in the rain
and her clothes had suffered. She had gone to the
"fessible," however, but it rained so hard that she,
with most of the others, had to stay all night.
There was a fight which scared her nearly to death,
and there was no place to sleep, for the older persons
took up all the floor space. She had walked
home when daylight came, and had gone to bed at
her mother's, but she was "clean tuckered out."
And, indeed, at intervals during the rest of the day,
one or another of the girls came upon her sound
asleep over her work.</p>

<p>At eleven o'clock came Aunt Sarah, accompanied
by Jack, who had met her at the train. Ordinarily
Nan would not have been so overjoyed to see Aunt
Sarah. There were too frequent passages of arms
between them for the girl to look forward to her
great aunt's visit with unalloyed pleasure, but this
time Miss Dent was given an exuberant welcome,
not only by Nan, but by the others. "We thought
you would never get here," said Nan.</p>

<p>"I thought so myself," returned Aunt Sarah.
"Henry Dent made me miss the train by five minutes
yesterday morning, so I had to take the afternoon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>train. That was an hour late owing to a
washout, so I couldn't make connection in Washington,
but had to stay all night there with Cousin
Lou, though I did get the earliest train this morning.
Your mother got off safely, Jack tells me. Why
aren't you children at school?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't any school to-day," promptly replied
Jean.</p>

<p>"How's that?" Miss Dent turned sharply.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Jean.</p>

<p>"Did you hear the reason?" asked Nan, turning
to Jack. She had been so occupied that the question
of school had given her very little thought that day.</p>

<p>"There wasn't one of the scholars there," replied
Jack truthfully and with a guileless look.</p>

<p>"How do you know?"</p>

<p>"I was down there and saw."</p>

<p>"Down where? Did you go to the schoolhouse?"</p>

<p>"I didn't go in."</p>

<p>"Didn't Miss Lawrence come?"</p>

<p>Jack hesitated, but she was equal to the emergency.
"I didn't see her," she made answer.</p>

<p>"I wonder if she is ill," said Mary Lee. "We
didn't hear that she was yesterday, and yet Jack
knew this morning before breakfast that there wasn't
to be any school. She told us so."</p>

<p>"How did you find out?" Aunt Sarah fixed a keen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>look upon Jack. "Look here, Jacqueline Corner, it
strikes me that there is a screw loose somewhere.
Did you tell your sister that there wouldn't be any
school so you could have a holiday?"</p>

<p>Jack faced her questioner unflinchingly. "It's
just as I said, Aunt Sarah. There wasn't truly any
school to-day."</p>

<p>"I'll find out the why and wherefore," replied
Aunt Sarah, shaking her head warningly. "How
did you get along, Nan? I suppose with Mitty and
Unc' Landy you have had no trouble."</p>

<p>"We had an awful time," Nan answered. "Mitty
took an afternoon and evening off. Mother promised
her long ago that she should go to the festival of the
Sons and Daughters of Moses and Aaron and we
had a terrible thunder-storm that scared us nearly to
death and that kept Unc' Landy from getting back
from the mill where he had gone for some feed.
Then the boys came and it was pitch dark before I
could get supper ready."</p>

<p>"Yes, and Jack fell down and mashed the cake
so some of it was crite flat," put in Jean.</p>

<p>"I don't care; it was dreadfully slippery coming
up the hill and, anyhow, it tasted good. Randolph
ate two pieces," protested Jack.</p>

<p>"So did you," retorted Jean.</p>

<p>"Hush, hush your squabbling, children," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>Aunt Sarah. "Well, Nan, you did have your hands
full. I'd have been more put out than I was if I had
known those boys were here. I suppose, though,
you didn't make any difference for them, just two
youngsters like them."</p>

<p>"Indeed we did make a difference," Jack told her
proudly. "We had out all the best china and silver,
and Nan made biscuits, and we borrowed cake from
Cousin Mag, and all that."</p>

<p>"For pity's sake, what did you make all that fuss
for over two young cubs of boys?"</p>

<p>"We wanted to give them a good impression,"
said Nan, with dignity. "Mother says so much
depends upon the first impression."</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah laughed. "Well, you might have
saved yourselves in my opinion. What are the lads
like? Nice fellows?"</p>

<p>"I suppose so," returned Nan doubtfully. "They
haven't given us much of a chance to find out.
Randolph says very little and Ashby nothing at all
except: 'Please pass the bread' or 'Please pass the
butter.'"</p>

<p>"Those remarks don't furnish much of a clue to
character," remarked Aunt Sarah with a little smile.
"Probably they are bashful and are not used to
girls. Here in a houseful of them with no older
person they feel mighty queer, I have no doubt.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>Their tongues will loosen up after a few days. You
put them in your room? Your mother wrote that
you wanted to."</p>

<p>"Yes, and we made it look pretty well. There
is a broken chair that Unc' Landy is going to mend,
and some of our clothes are still in the press."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll get myself settled and we'll soon have
things in running order," returned Aunt Sarah, rising
to go to her room.</p>

<p>Nan gave a sigh of relief. It lifted a great weight
from her shoulders to have capable Aunt Sarah on
hand, to know that in a few minutes the black cashmere
would be substituted by a neat calico and that,
in her working garb, Aunt Sarah would take control.</p>

<p>"Come, Mary Lee," said Nan, "Aunt Sarah will
see to everything. There is really nothing for us to
do, so let's go work in our gardens. It's a splendid
day for weeding."</p>

<p>The girls' gardens were side by side. In Nan's
grew currant bushes, a dwarf apple-tree, tiny tomatoes,
yellow and red, sweet corn, and in one corner,
pleasant smelling herbs, thyme, tansy, sage, lavender
and bergamot. Flowering beans ran over her share
of the fence, and a rollicking pumpkin vine sprawled
its length along the line between this and Mary
Lee's garden. All in Nan's garden appealed to the
senses. She gloated over the delicate pink blooms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>which covered her small tree in the spring. She reveled
in the shining red currants hanging in clusters
among the green leaves. She delighted in the
scarlet and yellow tomatoes, in the delicate bloom
of the lavender, the graceful green of the tansy, the
perfume of the bergamot. These gardens were
theirs provided they raised something useful, and
Nan had kept within the limits, but her mother
smiled to see how she had chosen.</p>

<p>Mary Lee, on the contrary, showed a practical
utilitarianism. Potatoes, onions, large lusty tomatoes,
solid cabbages, mighty turnips, radishes and
lettuce were what she aspired to cultivate, and right
well did the crops show.</p>

<p>"I think I'll have an asparagus bed next year,"
said Nan bending down to gather a leaf of bergamot.
"It looks so pretty and feathery, and after it is once
started it is no trouble at all."</p>

<p>"It will take up a lot of room," returned Mary
Lee. "I do wish you'd pull up that old pumpkin
vine; it's getting all in among my turnips."</p>

<p>"It's too late in the season for it to hurt them,"
returned Nan nonchalantly, "and I really can't keep
it on my side, Mary Lee, unless I sit here all day and
all night watching it, for it grows so fast I'm continually
having to unwind it from something. I
believe it is a fairy vine, an ogre&mdash;no, it's too jolly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>to be an ogre. It may be a playful giant that grabs
at everybody just to be funny."</p>

<p>"I don't think it's a bit funny," replied Mary Lee,
not possessing Nan's humor. "I just wish you'd
come and get it away from my side."</p>

<p>Nan stepped across the twig fence which separated
the two gardens. "Come here, old Giant
Pumpkin-head," she said. "You must stop curling
your fingers around everything you see. Stay on
your own side." She dragged the obtrusive length
of vine across to her own garden. "He does spread
mighty near over the whole place," she continued.
"I'm afraid I shall have to put a spell on him another
year. Oh, I know where I'll have him next season."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Mary Lee industriously pulling
up weeds which yielded easily after the rain.</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind where. I can't tell just yet,"
Nan hastened to say, for her thought was to allow
a pumpkin vine to have its own way upon the edge
of the field where she had her retreat. She, too, fell
to pulling weeds, but presently she cried: "Mary
Lee, Mary Lee, Miss Lawrence is coming up the
street and I believe she is coming to our house."</p>

<p>"Then she isn't ill," returned Mary Lee, brushing
the earth from her hands.</p>

<p>"No, and here comes Jack running for dear life.
I must go see what she wants. Heigho, Jack!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>
<p>The child came tumultuously toward them. "Oh,
Nan, don't let her see me," she cried.</p>

<p>"Let who see you?"</p>

<p>"Miss Lawrence. She's coming after me."</p>

<p>"Coming after you? and why? You know she's
not bothering about you unless you have been up to
some trick. Have you, Jack?"</p>

<p>Jack clung to Nan's hand. "I didn't tell a story.
There couldn't be any school when there were no
scholars, could there?"</p>

<p>"No, I suppose not."</p>

<p>"I did so want to help," said Jack. "I knew you
would have to stay home and get dinner if Aunt
Sarah didn't come, and I wanted to go and meet her
if she did."</p>

<p>"But what did you do?" Nan drew the child to
one side. "Now tell sister the whole truth, Jack,
and unless it is something perfectly dreadful, I'll try
to get you let off. What did you do?"</p>

<p>"I just told Carrie Duke and Laura Fitchett there
wouldn't be any school, and they went and told a
whole lot of the others, and when any one else came
along I told them, too. There wasn't any school, so
I didn't tell a story."</p>

<p>Nan giggled outright. She couldn't help it. Of
course, it was not right, but the plan was so ingenious
and the logic so like Jack's that she couldn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>be angry. Moreover, she was but a child herself
who liked a holiday. "I'll tell you what to do,"
she advised. "You go over to Cousin Mag's and
tell her I'll send back some cake to-morrow, that I am
very much obliged to her for helping us out, that
Aunt Sarah has come and that we shall have no more
trouble. Then I'll go up to the house and say I have
sent you on an errand. You may stay over there
for a little while, if you like. Of course," she
added, feeling that perhaps she was too lenient,
"you did very wrong, and if Miss Lawrence asks
me I shall have to tell her what you did, but if she is
very mad you'd better not be on hand, especially as
Aunt Sarah is there, too. Now, run along."</p>

<p>"Oh, Nan, you are so dear," cried Jack, giving her
a hug. "I haven't been comfortable all day, and
when I saw Miss Lawrence coming, and I felt so
afraid, like Adam and Eve in the garden, I knew I
hadn't done right. It didn't seem very wrong when
I first thought about it this morning."</p>

<p>"I can't say it was right," said Nan with decision,
"but go now." And Jack took the benefit of her
advice.</p>

<p>"I'm going up to the house to see Miss Lawrence,"
Nan called to Mary Lee. "Will you come,
too?"</p>

<p>"Not unless she particularly wants me. My
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>hands are a sight, and I do want to finish this weeding
while the ground is so nice and soft."</p>

<p>Nan went slowly toward the house. She did not
mean to excuse Jack but she meant to shield her. It
was always Nan's way and Jack realized that her
eldest sister was her most tolerant friend. There
were occasions when even Nan's patience gave out,
but her mother feeling for her little sister was too
strong for her not to love this wayward one, perhaps,
best of all.</p>

<p>She found Miss Lawrence and Miss Dent in animated
conversation. Miss Lawrence was hardly
through her greeting before she began to question.
"Why weren't you at school to-day, Nan?" she
asked.</p>

<p>"I couldn't come, Miss Lawrence. Mother went
yesterday, and our girl was away, too, so I just had
so much to do I couldn't come."</p>

<p>"Oh, I see. Miss Dent has been telling me of
your mother's absence. I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Nan, where is Jack?" asked Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>"I sent her on an errand, Aunt Sarah. She'll be
back after a while."</p>

<p>"Do you know anything of her having reported
that there would be no school to-day?" asked Miss
Lawrence severely. "Not a scholar came though I
waited till after ten. I could not imagine why it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>was and have tried to trace the cause. From what
I learned Jack was the first one who started the report.
Why did she think there would be no
school?"</p>

<p>Nan glanced at her Aunt Sarah and was relieved
to see that she did not wear her severest look though
Miss Lawrence looked sternly unsmiling. "I don't
think the way Jack looked at it," began Nan, addressing
Miss Lawrence, "that she meant to tell a
story. She said there couldn't be any school if there
were no scholars, and so she saw to it that there were
no scholars. She always wants to help and she knew
how busy I would be, but she knew, too, that I
would insist upon her going to school and so she
thought out this plan for having a holiday."</p>

<p>There was actually a smile on Aunt Sarah's face.</p>

<p>"That's Jack all over," she said. "And I know full
well that from her point of view she believed she
wasn't telling a story."</p>

<p>"That's what she said to me," Nan again asserted.</p>

<p>"It's most astonishing," said Miss Lawrence, but
even in her eyes there was a flicker of amusement
as she glanced at Miss Dent. "Of course, she must
be punished," she went on, "for she must realize
how wrong it was and such things cannot be overlooked."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<p>"She didn't really think about its being wrong
till she saw you coming," said Nan, "and then she
was scared to death, poor little Jack."</p>

<p>This was most tactful of Nan, for Miss Lawrence
had a great horror of being dreaded and disliked.
She believed in firmness but in gentle and loving control,
so she said, "She should not have been scared
of me, Nan. I am never unjust, I hope."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do to her?" asked Nan,
feeling that she must learn the worst. "If it's very
bad, Miss Lawrence, please let me take the punishment;
I'm bigger, you know."</p>

<p>The tears sprang to Miss Lawrence's eyes. Nan
had scored a second time, all unconsciously. "Why,
my dear, do you believe I could be harsh enough to
inflict anything dreadful upon a little girl? I assure
you I shall do nothing worse than keep her in after
school and give her a lecture, not an unkind one,
but I hope to be able to make her understand the
nature of an untruth better than she does now. I
am glad to know the exact facts, Nan; it will make
it easier for me to deal with her."</p>

<p>"Shall you tell the whole school?" asked Nan
anxiously.</p>

<p>Miss Lawrence considered the question. "No, I
think not. I will simply tell them that a false report
arose and that another time they must come to see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>for themselves, and that any announcement of a
holiday will be made from the desk by me personally."
She then bade Miss Dent good-bye, and
stooped to kiss Nan whose championship had won
the day for naughty little Jack.</p>

<p>Jack took her punishment stoically and the only
remark about it was in answer to her sister's question:
"Was it very dreadful, Jack? Was she awfully
solemn and terrible?"</p>

<p>Jack's reply was philosophical: "Sticks and stones
may break my bones, but words can never hurt me,"
she said gravely. And that was all any one was
ever able to get out of Jack.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />

<small>A TOURNAMENT WITH PETE</small></h2>


<p>As Aunt Sarah prophesied, the boys thawed out
in a few days, but did not promise by their manner
to offer any real companionship. Mary Lee
made a point of avoiding them while Nan was
perfectly indifferent, and only Jean went out of
her way to be agreeable.</p>

<p>"I think they're horrid," complained Mary Lee.
"Just because they have a finer house than this one
and their father has been some high muck-a-muck
they think they can look down on us."</p>

<p>"I don't believe they look down exactly; I think
it's because we are girls, and they're not used to
playing with girls. We belong to the same family
and it isn't anything much to be a Congressman.
I'm sure they're polite enough."</p>

<p>"But they're not a bit like Phil," replied Mary
Lee who measured all boys by that standard.</p>

<p>"It's because they're not used to girls," insisted
Nan; "that's what Aunt Sarah says, and Phil has
been used to us ever since he was born."</p>

<p>"But Phil says they're stuck up," persisted Mary
Lee, "and a boy ought to know."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, well, who cares?" returned Nan. "I'm
sure I don't, and I don't want boys tagging after
me wherever I go," which was something of a
fling at Mary Lee who generally preferred Phil's
company to that of any of her sisters.</p>

<p>It was Phil, after all, who did bring about a better
understanding between the cousins, so that all
spent many a holiday in common. It was one
Saturday when Phil came over to propose a "sure-enough"
tournament, that the fun commenced. He
had his own horse and proposed to beg, borrow
or&mdash;</p>

<p>"Not steal one for me," interrupted Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"I'll get one some way," said Phil. "We must
have more than one to enter the lists. The more
the better."</p>

<p>As a tournament was sufficiently romantic to
appeal to Nan she eagerly put in, "I'll be a knight."</p>

<p>"What'll you ride?" asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"Pete."</p>

<p>Phil tumbled back on the grass with a shout of
laughter, for Pete was the old mule which Unc'
Landy used for all farming purposes. He was
aged, half blind and evilly disposed, so his entering
a contest like a tournament seemed the height of
absurdity.</p>

<p>"You laugh mighty soon," retorted Nan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>"Maybe you reckon I can't ride Pete. I can do
more with him than any one."</p>

<p>"I think he'd be lots of fun," said Phil, sitting
up, his eyes twinkling with mirth. "I'll bring
Lightfoot and maybe I can get sister Polly's mare
for Mary Lee."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd love that," cried Mary Lee, enthusiastically.
"Who'll be the spectators?"</p>

<p>"We don't need any except the kids. Jack and
Jean will do," returned Phil. "We'll just ride for
the fun of the thing, you see."</p>

<p>"We can have a make-believe audience," said
Nan eagerly. "I'd love that. Where can we have
it, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Oh, over in the field, back where the road comes
in."</p>

<p>"How about rings? We must have rings."</p>

<p>"One will do. We can't expect to have many.
I can fix up one over the gate and if we take that
we shall do well."</p>

<p>"That will be a fine place," said Nan, hugging
her knees. "Go 'long, Phil, and get your horses
and I'll see about Pete. Unc' Landy isn't using
him to-day."</p>

<p>Phil went off with a chuckle, promising to return
in half an hour, and Nan flew to the house. It was
her intention to outdo them all in the matter of costume.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>Phil had declared his intention of tying some
sort of sash around his waist and of wearing his
brother Tom's Rough Rider hat with a feather in it.
Mary Lee said she would put on a red jacket and
tie a silk handkerchief around her head.</p>

<p>"I'll get up something," said Nan evasively. She
might not have the swiftest steed but she could
have the grandest costume. Whatever Nan went
into, she did with all her heart and her enthusiasm
went to full lengths whenever she entered any contest.</p>

<p>Nan had the faculty of mentally placing objects
in their relative places once she had seen them, and
on her way to the house she quickly made an inventory
of those things she should need. First
there was Jack's plaid skirt; it would about come
to her knees. A pair of leathern leggings her
mother had worn as part of her riding costume
when a girl, she remembered seeing in a trunk in
the attic. In this same trunk, to her satisfaction,
she came across some strips of plaid like the
skirt; these she considered a great find and bore
them down-stairs with the leggings.</p>

<p>Having arrayed herself in a green shirt-waist, the
plaid skirt and the leggings, Nan rummaged among
her treasures to find an old cairngorm pin which had
belonged to her Grandmother Lee, and which her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>mother had once given her as a birthday gift, lacking
anything new. Fashioning the plaid strips into
a scarf by pinning the longer ones together, she
fastened them at the shoulder with the pin. Then
her deft fingers contrived from some stiff paper, a
sort of Scotch cap. She gave this a coat of shoe
polish which dried quickly, and as a finishing touch
she pinned to it a long peacock feather which some
one had once given her.</p>

<p>When all was ready Nan surveyed herself in the
glass with much pride. Her ideas had been gleaned
from some pictures of Highland costumes which she
had often seen at her Cousin Mag's, and she had
determined to take the name of the Knight of
Snowdoun, knowing and loving well her "Lady of
the Lake."</p>

<p>On her way from the house she stopped in the
pantry and took three apples from the barrel standing
there. One of these she carefully pared and
slipped the paring into her pocket; the others she
took with her to the stable yard where old Pete
stood, his head over the fence. She rubbed his nose
gently and gave him the pared apple. If there was
anything Pete loved, it was apples, and with these
as a reward Nan knew she could do anything with
him, and indeed he allowed her to adjust his bridle
and to strap a folded horse blanket upon him and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>mount him easily, a bit of apple being the recompense
for such amiable behavior.</p>

<p>As Nan rode in state out of the yard in the direction
of the field, Ashby Gordon saw her and was
fascinated by her appearance.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" he called after
her.</p>

<p>Nan flashed him a merry look over her shoulder,
but made no reply.</p>

<p>There was something entirely too enticing in the
possibilities her looks presented and Ashby's curiosity
got the better of him. He ran to find
Randolph. "Come on, Ran," he said. "I wish
you'd see Nan. She looks stunning and she's riding
old Pete somewhere. Come on."</p>

<p>More impressed by Ashby's manner than his
words, Randolph followed his brother. As they
went out they caught sight of Nan just disappearing
down the road behind the barn. A dip in the hill
hid her from view in another moment, but they determined
to take the same direction to see what was
going on. Arriving upon the scene, they found Phil
on Lightfoot, Mary Lee riding her Cousin Polly's
Beauty, and the twins seated as spectators.</p>

<p>"What's going on?" asked Randolph.</p>

<p>"A tournament," said Phil. "There is the grandstand
if you want to look on."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, but I'd like to be in it, if I only had my
horse here," said Ran.</p>

<p>"So would I," put in Ashby. "My! but Nan
looks great. What are you, Nan?"</p>

<p>"I'm the Knight of Snowdoun, Mary Lee is the
Knight of the Red Jacket and Phil is the Knight of
Morro Castle because he is wearing a Rough
Rider hat."</p>

<p>"It's rather too big," said Phil. "I've got to take
a reef in it."</p>

<p>"We've only one ring," said Nan, "but we have
a large assemblage to look on. The Goldenrod
family are nearly all here. The Oaks are out in force
and the Maples are dressed up in their gayest clothes,
you see."</p>

<p>Ran looked at her with more interest than he had
ever shown. "I say," he remarked, "you look like
the real thing. Who's your herald?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we haven't any. Phil is going to call out:
'Prepare to charge,' and 'Charge,' unless," she said
graciously, "you'd like to do it."</p>

<p>"I'd like it first-rate," said Ran heartily.</p>

<p>"All right. That will help us out finely, won't it,
Phil?"</p>

<p>To which Phil replied: "It will make it more real,
I reckon."</p>

<p>"The other two had selected their ladies before I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>reached here," said Nan, "so if I win I'll have to
crown a make-believe. The crown is of red maple
leaves. Jean is making it now."</p>

<p>"If you win," said Mary Lee contemptuously,
being rather put out at the appearance of the Gordon
boys upon the scene.</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss High-and-Mighty," returned Nan.
"Because you have the best mount, you needn't
think you're going to have it all your own way. It
isn't the riding; it's the taking the ring. Two out
of three goes. Where are the lances, Phil?"</p>

<p>Phil produced three long straight poles made from
saplings, sharpened at the end, and soon all three
knights were mounted and in line. But just before
the herald uttered his first call, Nan lowered her
lance, drew from her pocket a piece of apple paring
and tied it upon the pole.</p>

<p>"What in the world are you doing?" cried Phil.</p>

<p>"I'm doing this to make Pete go," was the
answer. "If he smells this, he'll try to run for
it."</p>

<p>"That's not fair," cried Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"It is, isn't it, boys? When she has the best
horse she ought to let me do it, I think," declared
Nan.</p>

<p>"Oh, there wouldn't anything make that old
creature go," said Phil disparagingly. "He always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>sleeps while Unc' Landy has him in the plough, and
I reckon he'll do it now. Let her tole him on any
way she likes, Mary Lee; it will be more fun."</p>

<p>The Knight of the Red Jacket was the first to
start, but with such impetus did her steed go that it
took all her wits to hold in the spirited mare and her
lunge at the ring brought no result.</p>

<p>Nan came next. Pete, with the apple paring dangling
within a foot of his nose, got up his best speed
and galloped with noble effort to overtake this tid-bit.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Pete," cried Ashby, clapping his
hands, and the sly old mule, as if understanding,
dashed along at a rate which surprised every one.
Nan had ridden him bare-back too often not to know
his paces and though he had never before taken
quite such a gait she was secure in her faith in him
and actually took the ring, laughing as she slipped
down and offered Pete the bit of apple paring.</p>

<p>"I told you it was skill and not paces," said she
as she came back.</p>

<p>Phil was the next, and he, too, took the ring.</p>

<p>"It's not fair," pouted Mary Lee. "If you had
this horse, you'd go so fast you couldn't see anything."</p>

<p>"I'll change with you," cried Nan quickly.</p>

<p>"Suppose you do that," proposed Ran. "Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>each one will have a fair test. Nan can ride Mary
Lee's mare next time and Phil can take Pete. Then
the third time Phil can ride the mare, Mary Lee can
ride Pete, and Nan Lightfoot; that will give every
one an equal test."</p>

<p>Mary Lee objected to this, mainly because Ran
had proposed it, but the others overruled her and so
it was arranged, Nan a second time coming off victorious,
Phil knocking the ring from its place and
Mary Lee scoring not at all.</p>

<p>The third time no one won for Pete absolutely refused
to carry Mary Lee. He planted his feet obstinately
and firmly and when urged by repeated
blows from Ashby at the rear, kicked out so viciously
that Ashby speedily got out of the way. So
Nan and Mary Lee were obliged to change back
again, but even then Mary Lee was no more successful,
for by this time Pete's temper had been
tried beyond pacifying and he was sulky. No
amount of coaxing would urge him to go faster than
a slow walk, so it was decided to lead him aside
and Nan made her third essay upon Phil's horse,
without taking a ring. However, as it was, the
odds were in her favor, for she had outdistanced
her rivals and had shown herself the most expert in
the tourney. Therefore, it was she who was to
bestow the crown upon her chosen lady.</p>

<span class="caption">The Tournament</span></div>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"You might take one of us," said Jack wistfully,
who longed to be queen of Love and Beauty.</p>

<p>"I wish I could, but you didn't wear my colors
and I can't offend a brother knight or we might have
a joust which would end in bloodshed," said Nan
seriously, swinging the wreath of red and yellow
leaves upon her lance. "I'm sure I don't want to
give offense," she added.</p>

<p>Jack looked disappointed. "I thought, of course,
you'd choose me, Nan," she said.</p>

<p>"I will next time. We'll try it again some day,
and this time Phil can crown you as a maid of
honor."</p>

<p>This satisfied Jack who felt that to be the only
lady to wear a crown was sufficient honor.</p>

<p>Nan stood swinging her wreath and looking uncertainly
around the field. Upon a tall bramble a
single spray of white shone out, the bush evidently
having miscalculated the season and having imagined
that it was still summer. "Ah, my Lady
Bramble," cried Nan, "I will crown you, for you
must have expected something unusual or you
wouldn't be showing yourself at this time of year."
And she flung her garland over the bramble bush.</p>

<p>But just here their play was interrupted by a voice
at the fence, saying, "Who got dat mewl?"</p>

<p>Nan ran toward Unc' Landy who looked at her in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>disapproving surprise. "What all dis? Dis ain' no
way fo' young ladies to dress. None o' de fambly
evah done disher way 'scusin' dey goes to er
ball."</p>

<p>"It's a tournament, Unc' Landy, and I took the
ring," cried Nan joyously. "You ought to have
seen Pete run the first time, but he was awfully
obstinate at the last."</p>

<p>"Pete? You ain' ride dat ole mewl to no tournymint?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did and he ran, really he did. I'll tell you
why." And Nan told how she had lured on the old
creature by the odor of apples.</p>

<p>At this story all Unc' Landy's disapproval vanished
and he burst into a loud guffaw. "I say yuh meks
him run," he cried. "I knows now how to git
wuk outen him."</p>

<p>"Oh, but you mustn't fool him," said Nan. "I
gave him the apple afterward. It would never do
to make him run that way every day or he'd die in
his tracks."</p>

<p>"He sholy would ef he keep up dat gait. Come
erlong hyar, yuh ole fool creetur. Whafo' yuh
kickin' up yo' heels lak yuh young an' frolicsome?
I knows yo' age. Come on hyar." And he led off
the old mule while every now and then he doubled
over with mirth, repeating: "I say run."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>
<p>"It was great fun," declared Ran. "I didn't
know girls ever did such things."</p>

<p>"We do," returned Nan. "We do all sorts of
things and mother doesn't care so long as it isn't actually
wrong. She likes us to be out-of-doors. We
girls play baseball and do lots of things like that."</p>

<p>"Nan won't always play," complained Mary Lee.
"She gets too young ladyish sometimes and goes off
somewhere to mope."</p>

<p>"I don't mope," returned Nan, "but there are
other things I like to do. I don't like boys' games
all the time, only sometimes. I don't like to go fishing
because I hate squirming worms on hooks, and
I feel sorry for poor gasping fish."</p>

<p>"Oh, but we have to have them for food," said
Ashby.</p>

<p>"I know we do, but I'd rather not do the catching.
I'll let you do that," she added laughing.</p>

<p>They were all on thoroughly good terms by this
time and since the afternoon was not over, they took
turns in riding, Ran showing himself so expert as to
pick up his cap from the ground while going at full
speed. He was able, too, to ride standing, bareback
or any other way, winning great applause for his
cow-boy acts.</p>

<p>"I believe I'll ask father to let us have our horses
up here," he said. "It would be no end of comfort
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>and if we had some kind of trap we could take you
girls off on long drives."</p>

<p>"We have an old phaeton," said Nan; "it's rather
dingy looking, but that is all that is the matter with
it, and there is the sleigh. We don't need either
since we sold the horses, but mother doesn't like to
part with them for the small price we could get for
them and she says maybe some day we can afford
to keep a horse."</p>

<p>"We must surely see about having our horses
here," repeated Ran, and that very night he wrote
home to his father to make the request.</p>

<p>A week later the horses arrived and were stabled
near-by. Polly Lewis was generous enough to send
her mare to one of the girls once in a while and so
many a long and delightful ride did the cousins have.
Sometimes several of them would pile into the old
phaeton and sometimes two would go horseback and
the rest would drive. Strange to say, though Mary
Lee was so much less impetuous than Nan, and
fonder of boys' sports, she sat a horse less well and
was never the graceful and fearless rider that Nan
was, though many a girl might have envied even
her good seat and steady hand.</p>

<p>There were other tourneys, too, when Randolph
generally was victor and crowned Jean who was his
special favorite, thus causing pangs of jealousy in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>Jack's ambitious heart. Nan, seeing this, resolved
to do her best for Jack's sake and practiced so diligently
that once Ran's successes rendering him careless,
she actually did take the championship from
him and to Jack's great delight, crowned this little
sister, making a flowery speech as she did so.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah smiled contemptuously at these performances
which she called "fool nonsense," but
since the children kept well, were not in bad company,
and did not neglect their school duties, she did
not forbid them their exciting plays. After the arrival
of the horses belonging to the Gordon boys, Pete
was not again expected to play the part of a curvetting
steed, but was allowed to rest on his laurels.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />

<small>THE SUNSET-TREE</small></h2>


<p>Although the girls had plenty of time for play, Aunt
Sarah saw to it that they had no really idle moments.
She was the most industrious of persons herself and
accomplished wonders which she explained by saying
her daily nap of half an hour so fortified her that
she could do two days' work in one by taking two
rests in the twenty-four hours. She was quick to
perceive defects in young people and in a half sarcastic,
half humorous way, commented upon them.
Upon Jean, such remarks had little effect; they angered
Jack, slightly annoyed Mary Lee, but they
hurt Nan to the quick, she being the most sensitive
of them all. Proud and romantic, high-spirited and
impatient, she was often thrown from a pinnacle of
eager expectation into the depths of a present discomfort.
It was on such occasions that she fled to
her nook in the pines which she had finally named
"Place o' Pines." Here she would often solace herself
by writing to her mother whom she missed,
perhaps, more than any of the others did. Reports
coming from Mrs. Corner were on the whole favorable.
"If I can stay long enough," she wrote, "the
doctors give me every hope of entire recovery."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>
<p>It was one afternoon when Aunt Sarah had been
particularly exacting that Nan fled to Place o' Pines.
She had not been there for some time, having been
occupied in too many ways to have many moods.
This, however, had been a particularly horrid day.
In the first place she had come down late to breakfast
and Aunt Sarah had said: "Good-afternoon,"
when she entered the dining-room. That made all
the others giggle and she felt so small. She needn't
have been late, of course, but while she was putting
on her shoes and stockings she thought of a new
tune and had been humming it over so as not to lose
the air, and, as she sat there dreaming, the time
slipped away.</p>

<p>Then of course, Mary Lee might have seen that
she was in a bad humor and should not have teased
her about dawdling, making her answer sharply.</p>

<p>"You old sharp corner," Mary Lee then had said.</p>

<p>"You're a Corner yourself as much as I am,"
Nan had retorted. "You're an angle; you're an
angle worm," was Mary Lee's triumphant
reply. And then Randolph had shouted with
laughter. Nan's cheeks reddened as she remembered
his mirth. She hated to be laughed
at, especially by boys, and by older boys worst of
all. She didn't mind Ashby and Phil so much, for
they were younger, but she did very much mind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>Randolph's laughter, so she had taken to her heels
and had not spoken to any of them since. She
hoped they would let her alone and that she would
be safe in her hiding-place till supper-time.</p>

<p>It was two months since her mother had left
home and longer since she had parted from her
Aunt Helen. As she came through the orchard to
where the pines stood sombrely green, she saw a
charred space just outside her tiny grove. The
boys had evidently been there roasting potatoes, for
there were skins and corn-husks scattered about.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear," sighed Nan, "if they have found
out my darling grove, I shall never have any more
peace." But, apparently, the boys had not entered
the charmed castle, for as Nan crept through the
underbrush she saw that all was as she had left it,
only a bit of white paper fluttered from the
music rack to which it was fastened by a pin.</p>

<p>"They have been here after all," she exclaimed,
"and have found me out. I suppose that is some
foolish note they have left." She took the paper
to the edge of the grove where it was lighter and
read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come, come, come,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Come to the sunset-tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The day is past and gone;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The woodman's axe lies free,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And the reaper's work is done.<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Come at ten o'clock to-morrow by command
of your</p>

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Fairy Godmother</span>.<br />
</p>

<p>"<i>October 14.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Surprised and pleased, Nan's first thought was
"I must go tell mother." Then with a rush came
the recollection of her mother's absence. She was
the only one who knew the secret. Her Aunt
Helen had returned. Had she come alone?</p>

<p>Nan looked across the little brook toward Uplands.
The house seemed as silent and deserted as in the
weeks and months past. Slipping the paper into
her blouse, she determined to go and reconnoitre.</p>

<p>The house looked grim and uninviting. Nan
wondered if ever it had seemed otherwise, if ever
the doors had been thrown open and from the windows
had looked smiling faces, her Aunt Nancy's,
her Aunt Helen's, her father's. The stick-tights and
jimson weed held her with detaining hands as
she ran back through the unmown lawn. They
seemed like unseen fingers from fairies under a
spell. Nan wondered at what mystic word the
doors of this haunted dwelling would fly open to
her.</p>

<p>"Suppose," Nan said to herself, "an ogre lived
in that dark woods and I was in his power." She
gave a little self-reproachful sigh as she reached the
sunset-tree. "Mother would tell me that I was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>the power of an ogre, I suppose," she continued,
sitting down on the gnarled roots which stretched
far along above soil. "Mother would say old ogre
Impatience and the bad fairy that makes me get to
dreaming, had me in their clutches. Maybe they
have. I wish I could tell my fairy godmother
about it, and that she could give me a phial of
precious liquid to squeeze on the ogre's eyelids so
he would go to sleep and never wake up; and I
wish she would give me a charm to change the
fairy that makes me dream into one that would
make me jump right up and get dressed in a jiffy.
I wonder why it is I always love so to moon over
my shoes and stockings. All sorts of ideas come
to me then. Perhaps if I did nothing but put on
shoes and stockings I'd some day have an idea come
to me that would be worth while." The whimsy
of spending the rest of her life in putting on shoes
and stockings made her laugh.</p>

<p>The sunset was gorgeous gold and red over the
top of the hill. Lakes and mountains and turreted
cities appeared in the sky. "The holy city," said
Nan, becoming grave. "That is where papa is.
Now up go the roses," she went on as pink clouds
detached themselves and drifted off overhead. "I'm
sending you those roses, papa," she said. "Please
take them into heaven with you and I'll try to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>rid of the ogre Impatience and the Poppy fairy.
Poppies put you to sleep they say, so I'll call her
that. To-morrow I'll stand on one foot to put on
my shoes and stockings, for if I sit down I am lost.
I wish I knew, papa darling, if you could look
through those bright golden cracks in the sky and
could see me standing here under the sunset-tree."</p>

<p>She returned soberly home and deliberately sought
out Mary Lee and the boys whom she found practicing
the double shuffle on the back porch.</p>

<p>"Where have you been?" asked Ran, pleasantly.</p>

<p>"In the enchanted woods," returned Nan, "but
it was getting gruesome there so I came away."</p>

<p>Ran laughed. He was getting used to these
speeches from Nan, and rather liked them.</p>

<p>"I can do it now," said Mary Lee eagerly. "I
got Mitty to show me. See, Nan." And she executed
the step easily.</p>

<p>"I don't know that step, but I know another one,"
said Nan, glad to perceive that her ill temper of the
morning was forgotten, and being a little ashamed
of supposing that they would miss her much when
she went off alone.</p>

<p>The noise of their break-downs brought Aunt
Sarah to the door. "What in the world are you all
doing?" she asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>
<p>"Just doing some steps," replied Mary Lee, expertly
executing her double shuffle.</p>

<p>"You might have been better employed," returned
Aunt Sarah. "It would have been just as
well, Mary Lee, if you had been giving some attention
to darning your stockings. There is a fine
large hole in the knee of one where you scraped it
against a tree you were climbing, I suppose. And,
Nan, it wouldn't do any harm if you were to see
where you left the shirt-waist you took off this
morning. We are not Japanese to hang up things
on the floor."</p>

<p>"I wish we were," answered Nan. "I'd like to
wear kimonos and shoes that slip up and down at
the heel, and I'd not mind living in a house made of
paper screens."</p>

<p>"Poor protection they'd be to you," replied Aunt
Sarah, "for you would punch a hole in every one
before a day was over."</p>

<p>Nan was not destructive and considered this an
unjust imputation, so she stalked off with her head
in the air. She didn't believe but that she had hung
up the shirt-waist and that it had slipped down.
Aunt Sarah was so particular and was always dinging
at her about leaving bureau drawers and closet
doors unclosed. When one is in a hurry, how is it
possible always to see that everything is just so?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>
<p>She found the waist not on the floor of the closet,
but by the chair where she had laid her clothes the
night before. There were some of Jack's belongings,
too, strewed around the room, but Mary Lee's
and Jean's were carefully put away. Nan hung up
the waist and then sat down by the window.
Suppose the things in the big house at Uplands had
been allowed to lie around helter-skelter, she didn't
believe it would look so attractive as she imagined.
This brought a new train of thought which she
carried out, leaning her arms on the sill, her chin
resting upon them till Aunt Sarah's entrance aroused
her from her reverie.</p>

<p>"Up in the clouds, I suppose," she exclaimed.
"You ought to live in a balloon or a sky-scraper,
Nan, you so seldom want to come down to earth.
I want you to find Jack and Jean and tell them to
come in and get ready for supper."</p>

<p>Nan departed on her errand, smiling to herself in
the thought that she had a secret from them all.
She was out of sorts with everybody in the house,
but to-morrow would be the sunset-tree and
Aunt Helen.</p>

<p>She was promptly on hand at the trysting-place
the next morning, though finding some difficulty in
getting there in time as it seemed that Aunt Sarah
had a hundred things for her to do. That she did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>not dream over them goes without the saying, and
Aunt Sarah congratulated herself upon the seeming
improvement under her reproofs. Promptly, as Nan
appeared, the little figure of her Aunt Helen was
seen approaching her. She did not wait for Nan
to come up but ran toward her and clasped her in
her arms, and Nan gave her as close a hug. Her
imagination was strongly appealed to by this relative,
so little known and who had chosen such
fascinating methods of becoming acquainted.</p>

<p>"You dear Aunt Helen," cried Nan, "where did
you come from?"</p>

<p>"You know me then," said her aunt.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes. When I told mother, she guessed
who you were."</p>

<p>"And she let you come to meet me to-day?" said
Miss Helen, with a strain of eagerness in her voice.</p>

<p>"She didn't know. She wasn't here to ask.
She's gone away, you know."</p>

<p>"I didn't know. Tell me about it, please."</p>

<p>Nan poured forth her woes and fears concerning
her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, oh, dear," sighed Miss Helen. "We
didn't know. Oh, my dear."</p>

<p>"Do you think she may be very ill?" asked Nan
her eyes wide with alarm.</p>

<p>"I hope not. I hope not." Her aunt spoke more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>cheerfully. "No doubt she will get quite well
where she is."</p>

<p>"She says she will if she can stay long enough."</p>

<p>"She must stay." Miss Helen spoke with decision.
"Did she mind very much, Nancy, that
you met me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no; she was glad. She said&mdash;&mdash;" the girl
hesitated.</p>

<p>"Go on, please." Miss Helen spoke pleadingly.</p>

<p>"She told me that she had said something that
she regretted."</p>

<p>"And that was&mdash;&mdash;" Miss Helen leaned forward
eagerly and caught Nan's hand in a tight clasp.</p>

<p>"That she never wanted to see any of the Corner
family again," here Nan hurried on. "It wasn't
any wonder, was it, when she was in such trouble
and distress?"</p>

<p>"I never blamed her," murmured her aunt.</p>

<p>"She said she ought to have tried to be friendly
to you and"&mdash;Nan looked up shyly, "that you used
to love me dearly."</p>

<p>"I've always loved you dearly," returned her aunt
warmly, "and I hope I always shall. Ah, my dear,
you don't know what it is to have those dreadful
bitternesses come into a family. I loved you all,
your father, your mother, you children, but I loved
my mother, too, and she needed me, for I was all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>she had left, and&mdash;well, never mind now. I am so
very glad time has softened your mother's feeling,
toward me at least, and I am so sorry, so very sorry,
that she is not well. Poor dear Jack, it would have
been a blow to him."</p>

<p>"Don't say that! Don't!" cried Nan. "It makes
me feel as if I ought to be scared and trembly about
mother and I don't want to." She put her head
down in Miss Helen's lap and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"My dearest child," cried Miss Helen, "please
don't cry. You make me so miserable."</p>

<p>"I won't cry," said Nan lifting her head. "She is
better, oh, she is, Aunt Helen."</p>

<p>"I am sure of it, darling. Now, do you want to
know what brings me here?"</p>

<p>"I do indeed."</p>

<p>"I have crossed the ocean twice since I saw you.
I took your kiss to your grandmother all the way
over with me, and oh, Nannie, dear, you don't know
how much it meant to her! The first tears I have
seen her shed for many a long day came to her eyes
when I told her about you and what you said.
Then she was restless and unhappy until she decided
that nothing would do but she must see you.
At first she urged me to send for you or to come
over and bring you back, but I could not leave her
and I doubted if you would be allowed to come.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>When she realized that, for the first time in all these
years, she expressed a desire to come back to
America. She has come to see you, Nannie. You
won't refuse to go to her, will you?"</p>

<p>Nannie's heart was beating fast. At last she was
to see the beautiful grandmother whose eyes followed
her about from the portrait over the mantel.
"Oh, I want to see her," she said. "I can't ask
mother, but I know she would say yes; I know
she would. Where is she, Aunt Helen? And when
can I see her?"</p>

<p>"She is coming home. She is coming here as
soon as I can get the house ready. She is with
friends in Washington and I have engaged Martha
Jackson to come over to clean the house and with
Henry Johnson's help we shall soon have everything
in order."</p>

<p>"I wish I could help," exclaimed Nan.</p>

<p>"Would you really like to?"</p>

<p>"I certainly would."</p>

<p>"Then you may. We'll go right over now for I
promised Martha I'd come back soon so she would
know what to do next."</p>

<p>This prospect of helping at Uplands was one of
sheer delight to Nan. It was what gave her the
greatest pleasure, and this opportunity of becoming
intimate with the furnishings of the house at Uplands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>was beyond anything she had ever hoped
for.</p>

<p>Through the long weeds the two made their way
to spend the day in uncovering furniture, unpacking
boxes and setting things to rights generally. During
the process, Nan became confidential and revealed
more of her own character and of her home life than
she could have done in days of ordinary intercourse,
so that Miss Helen came to know them all through
her: Jean's gentle sweetness, Jack's passionate outbursts
and mischievous pranks, Mary Lee's fondness
for sports and her little self-absorbed ways; even
Aunt Sarah stood out on all the sharp outlines of
her peculiarities. Her unselfishness and her generosity
were made as visible as her sarcasms and tart
speeches, so that Miss Helen often smiled covertly
at Nan's innocent revelations.</p>

<p>There was uncovered, too, the lack of means, the
make-shifts and goings without in some such speech
as: "Dear me, I wonder if our old sofa ever looked
like that when its cover was fresh and new. It's
just no color now and mother has patched and
darned it till it can't hold together much longer, and
the springs make such a funny squeak and go way
down when you sit on it. Jack has bounced all the
spring out of it, I reckon;" or, "we had a pretty
pitcher something like that but Jack broke it and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>now we have to use it in our room, for you know we
couldn't let the boys use a pitcher with a broken nose."</p>

<p>There were moments, too, when Nan spoke of
the ogre Impatience and the Poppy fairy, both of
whom Miss Helen seemed to know all about, for
she fell in so readily with all Nan's fanciful ideas
that the child felt as if she had known her always,
and often would fly at her impetuously and give her
a violent hug, frequently to the peril of some delicate
ornament or fragile dish which she might
have in her hand.</p>

<p>As room after room was restored to its former
condition, Nan breathed a soft: "Oh, how lovely,"
but when the drawing room was revealed and all
the beautiful pictures were unveiled, she sat in the
middle of the floor and gazed around. All this she
had longed to see and now she was in the midst of
it. "I have a right to be here, haven't I, Aunt
Helen?" she asked. "I really have a right. You
invited me."</p>

<p>"Why, of course, Nan."</p>

<p>"I shall tell Aunt Sarah I had. She will say I
sneaked in or stood around till you had to ask me,
but I didn't."</p>

<p>"Of course not, you silly little girl. Come now,
I am half starved. Let us go see what Martha has
ready for us."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot about eating. I wonder what
Aunt Sarah will say to my not coming home."</p>

<p>"Will she be alarmed?"</p>

<p>"No, not that exactly, because sometimes I take
my pocket full of biscuits and stay out all day on Saturdays.
I play I'm all sorts of people and that I
have all kinds of wonderful things to eat. Have I
ever had a meal in this house?"</p>

<p>"Many a time you have sat in your father's high-chair,
and have banged on the table with a spoon,
and, later on, you had many a sly meal with us
when you would run off and I would catch you coming
here. You couldn't cross the brook but would
stand on the other side and call to me, 'Nenny,
Nenny,' for that was as near Helen as you could
get."</p>

<p>Nan sighed. "I really think I ought to go home.
I could come back, I think."</p>

<p>"And leave me to eat my luncheon alone?"</p>

<p>Nan hesitated. It didn't seem very kind to do
that, so she overcame her scruples and sat down to
the meal Martha had prepared for them, wondering
what Aunt Sarah would say when she heard about it.
She felt a little startled when she stopped to consider
possibilities. Aunt Sarah, though tart of speech,
seldom resorted to active punishment unless she
considered the limit had been overstepped, then she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>did not hesitate to mete out supperless solitary confinement
to the aggressor. "I don't care," said Nan
resolutely to herself, "I'm not going to be impolite
to Aunt Helen even if Aunt Sarah doesn't approve.
She can punish me if she wants to. I shall not mind
going without my supper." In consequence she
ate a hearty luncheon, being hungry from exertion
and, moreover, wisely providing for future possible
fasting.</p>

<p>It was a memorable day and when at last they left
the house and Miss Helen locked the door behind
them she told Nan that she would hang out from the
second story window a red cloth as a signal when
she had returned from Washington, and that Nan
was to come over after that as soon as possible.
She kissed the child good-bye and said, "I dreaded
coming back, Nannie dear, but now I am glad to
come since I have seen you."</p>

<p>So Nan went off with an exultant feeling in her
heart. It was all like a fairy tale; Aunt Helen the
fairy godmother, her grandmother the queen of
the fairies. This was the enchanted castle and Nan
was to be given entrance to it. She ran down the
hill, stopped at the sunset-tree to look at the reddening
sky, crossed the brook, and ran plump into
Aunt Sarah.</p>

<small>IMPRISONMENT</small></h2>


<p>"Nancy Weston Corner," exclaimed Aunt Sarah,
"where have you been all day? Who was that you
were talking to up there at the house? I saw you
coming away."</p>

<p>"It was my Aunt Helen," replied Nan, stoutly.</p>

<p>"And have you been up there hobnobbing with
her and that wicked old mother of hers?"</p>

<p>"I reckon I've a right to hobnob with my own
aunt," retorted Nan, immediately up in arms, "and
as for my grandmother, she isn't there and she'd not
be wicked if she were."</p>

<p>"Much you know about it. If you did know,
you'd have more pride than to insinuate yourself into
a household where you are not wanted."</p>

<p>"I do know all about it, and I didn't insinuate
myself; I was invited. Aunt Helen invited me."</p>

<p>"When did you see her? How did she find you
out?"</p>

<p>"I saw her weeks ago and my mother knew all
about it. She did not object in the least."</p>

<p>"That's a likely story."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>
<p>Nan's eyes flashed. "I'll thank you to believe,
Miss Sarah Elizabeth Dent, that I don't tell stories."</p>

<p>"Don't you speak to me in that way," returned
Aunt Sarah angrily. "March yourself home. You
know as well as you're alive that neither your
mother nor I ever cross the brook and that you are
not allowed to do it either."</p>

<p>Nan wrenched her shoulder from Aunt Sarah's
grasp. "I don't care anything about what you do,"
she said, rebelliously; "my mother knows I go to
my grandmother's house, so there."</p>

<p>"We'll see about this," said Aunt Sarah. "Not a
step do you go from the house till I have word from
your mother. I'd be ashamed to be beholden to
them for so much as a crust of bread, and to let
them have the chance to patronize you after all that
is past is more than my family pride will allow.
You knew perfectly well I would never give my
consent to your going there and you sneaked off
without so much as a word to any one and were
gone all day so that I worried&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't see why you worried," Nan interrupted.
"I am often gone all day."</p>

<p>"Don't contradict me," said Aunt Sarah severely.
"There is one thing I will not stand from servants
and children and that is impertinence. You can go
to my room and stay there till I can inquire into this.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>I'll sleep with Mary Lee. You don't cross the
threshold of that room till your mother says so."</p>

<p>Nan's indignation by this time had risen to its
greatest height. If she were to be punished for one
impertinence, why not for more? So she turned and
said: "You needn't touch me; I'll go. But I'll tell
you one thing; that I don't believe my grandmother
is half as wicked as you are and she'd not treat me
this way no matter what. If I do go to your room
I shall ask the Lord to bless her in her down-sittings
and her up-risings just the same. You can write to
my mother if you want to, and ask her if I did
wrong to go to see my Aunt Helen. I know what
she will say and I'll ask her if I can't stay there
altogether till she comes back. They wouldn't call
me a story-teller and they'd treat me better than you
do. They are nearer kin anyhow."</p>

<p>Having delivered herself of this indignant speech,
Nan took to her heels, reached the house, ran to her
aunt's room and slammed the door after her, then
she burst into tears of rage. Never before had her
temper brought her to the making of such remarks
to Aunt Sarah. They had had their little tiffs but
such anger on both sides had never been displayed.</p>

<p>If there was one subject above another upon
which Miss Sarah was excitable, it was the Corner
family. She resented to the very core of her being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>the elder Mrs. Corner's neglect of her son's family,
and that Nan should deliberately make overtures
aroused all her indignation. Nan could have said
nothing to enrage her more than to compare her
unfavorably with Mrs. Corner, senior. So there was
open war between them and Nan might well feel
that she had gone too far.</p>

<p>However, the girl was more aggrieved and angry
than sorry, and was specially annoyed that she had
been sent to her aunt's room; that seemed to her a
needless severity, for what harm would there be in
allowing her to occupy the room she shared with her
sisters? But it was some satisfaction, Nan reflected,
that her aunt was punishing herself likewise, for she
disliked a bedfellow.</p>

<p>It was not long before Jack's pattering feet were
heard upon the stair and presently she burst into
the larger room calling: "Nannie, Nannie, where
are you?"</p>

<p>"Here," answered Nan in a depressed voice.</p>

<p>Jack stuck her head in at the door. "What you
in here for, Nan?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Aunt Sarah sent me," returned Nan, biting her
lip and trying to keep the tears back.</p>

<p>"Why, what for?"</p>

<p>"Just because I went to Uplands without asking
her. Mother did not object when she was here,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>and Aunt Helen was there and wanted me." It was
a relief to pour out her grievances if only to Jack.</p>

<p>"A fellow feeling makes us wondrous kind,"
and Jack's own experiences made her appreciate
the situation. Moreover, it seemed the height of
calamity to her that Nan should be punished; Nan,
who was the eldest and who really had a right to
read lectures to her younger sisters. That she
should be in disgrace was something to awe and
impress one. "She's a mean old thing," said Jack
winding her arms around her sister's neck. "Who's
Aunt Helen, Nannie?"</p>

<p>"Papa's own sister, and she has come back to
Uplands. I saw her before mother went away,
but I didn't tell any one but mother. It was a secret
and I couldn't tell. She wants me to come over
there as soon as she and grandmother get back from
Washington, and now I can't go for Aunt Sarah
says I must stay here till she hears from mother.
She was just furious with me. They are not her
kinsfolk; I don't see why she should meddle.
Aunt Helen will expect me and will wonder why I
don't come." And the tears again started to Nan's
eyes.</p>

<p>"I'll go tell her and then she'll know why," said
Jack generously.</p>

<p>"And get punished, too. No, ducky dear, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>can't have that, but it is good of you to offer to go.
I'll have to think out some way, for if I am to be
shut up here till Aunt Sarah hears from mother,
Aunt Helen must have some word. I don't think I
did a thing wrong in going to see my own aunt,
but Aunt Sarah says I have no pride, and that it is
wicked to think of wanting to go over there, but
that is just her way of thinking. It isn't mine at all,
and it is horrid, horrid for her to shut me up as if I
were a baby, and to shame me before&mdash;before the
boys."</p>

<p>Jack gazed at her in silent sympathy. She understood
all about it. Many and many a time had she
passed through just such tribulations. Many and
many a time had she been punished for something
in which she could see no wrong. How many
times had her motives been misunderstood, and how
often had she been censured for what seemed to
her a praiseworthy act? Oh, yes, she could readily
sympathize with Nan, and because Nan had more
than once helped her out of a difficulty, she would
do her best for her sister. "I'll bring you something
to eat," she promised. "You shan't be fed
on bread and water, and I'll tell the boys that Aunt
Sarah is an old witch and is just torturing you."</p>

<p>Nan at that moment felt like heartily endorsing
that opinion but she suddenly remembered that it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>would never do to undermine Aunt Sarah's authority
over Jack, so she replied rather weakly: "Oh, I
suppose it is all right. She thinks she is doing the
best thing because she doesn't know all about it.
When she hears from mother, she will understand.
I don't mind anything so much as disappointing
Aunt Helen. I wish you would find Mary Lee and
send her to me," she said with sudden resolution,
feeling that Jack's championship might not serve
her as well as Mary Lee's, for the latter being a
calm and more dispassionate person was usually
more convincing, and if Nan could persuade her
that she was a martyr, the boys would be given a
proper view of the situation.</p>

<p>"What do you want Mary Lee for?" asked Jack
a little jealously and because she must always know
the whys and wherefores.</p>

<p>"I want to see her before Aunt Sarah does," said
Nan with a ghost of a smile, and Jack departed
upon her errand.</p>

<p>It was not long before Mary Lee, all curiosity,
made her appearance. That Aunt Sarah should
have exercised her authority in such a decided manner,
and that Nan should have fallen under her displeasure
was a matter of no small moment to each
of the four Corners, for who knew now where the
blow might next fall? "Of course," commented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>Mary Lee, when Nan's story was told, "it was because
you didn't ask Aunt Sarah's permission, and
because you answered her so. And then, I really
don't see, Nan, how you could have been willing to
go over there, after all that has happened. You
know how Aunt Sarah feels about it and mother,
too."</p>

<p>"Mother isn't so dead set against our going
there," Nan informed her. "She would like to
make up with Aunt Helen, I know she would, and
I know she will say I am to go if I choose."</p>

<p>"Well I shouldn't choose," returned Mary Lee,
her head in air. "I don't see how you can feel so.
I shouldn't want to make up with them when they
have treated mother so mean."</p>

<p>"Aunt Helen hasn't. She's always loved us, but
she had to stand by her mother and that was right,"
persisted Nan. Then in a little superior way&mdash;"You
don't understand all the ins and outs of it as
I do, Mary Lee."</p>

<p>"I don't care," returned Mary Lee, immediately
on the defensive. "I think you are very mealy-mouthed
and are not showing proper respect to the
family."</p>

<p>"Pooh!" returned Nan. "Just you wait till you
hear what mother has to say."</p>

<p>This confidence in her mother's opinion somewhat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>altered Mary Lee's point of view. "Well,"
she said, "I wouldn't have gone myself, still, I
think Aunt Sarah has no right to punish big girls like
us for something our mother would not scold us
for. She ought to wait till she knows for sure before
she ups and makes a prisoner of one of us."</p>

<p>"She'd think she had a right to shut mother up if
she did anything Aunt Sarah disapproved of," said
Nan, mournfully. "Tell me, Mary Lee, how are
you going to explain it to the boys?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell them the truth."</p>

<p>"But you can't say there is a family quarrel and
that we aren't allowed to visit our own nearest relations."</p>

<p>"Yes I can. Everybody knows it or suspects it,
and we are not the only ones that have had a family
quarrel. <i>We</i> can't help our grandmother's being a
horrid old skinflint."</p>

<p>"Oh!" Nan was about to defend her grandmother
vigorously but concluded to say only:
"Maybe she didn't mean to be quite so horrid as she
seemed. When people get mad they say lots of
things they don't mean. I know I do."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, I know you do," returned Mary Lee,
"but a grown-up old woman ought to do better.
I hope you will when you are her age." At which
sisterly reproof Nan had nothing to say. "At all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>events," Mary Lee continued, "I'll stand by you,
Nan, and I know the boys will, too."</p>

<p>After Mary Lee left her, Nan reviewed the situation.
If her Aunt Sarah's ire cooled she would
probably be liberated the next day and her Aunt
Helen would not arrive from Washington till Monday
anyhow. On the other hand, if her Aunt
Sarah's anger, instead of cooling should wax
stronger, Nan could not expect to be free till her
mother should be heard from, and that would be in
not less than three days; in all probability it would
be four. Nan counted on her fingers: Sunday,
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday; very likely Wednesday,
for Aunt Sarah would hardly have her letter
ready before the morning's mail. "I wish she'd
send a telegram," sighed Nan, "but she'll just like
to keep me here as long as she can; I've made her
so hopping mad."</p>

<p>Nan's conscience told her that Aunt Sarah did
have a right to be more than usually angry at her
impertinence, but she chose to see only her own side
of the case and would admit herself nothing but a
martyr. True to her expectation, no supper was
forthcoming and before that hour her door was
securely locked on the other side. She was indeed
a prisoner.</p>

<p>In spite of her hearty luncheon, Nan felt the pangs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>of hunger about the supper hour. She had a healthy
appetite and, as the odor of hot biscuits stole upward
from the kitchen, she realized that hers was
no pleasant predicament. "Old witch aunt! Old
witch aunt!" she murmured under her breath. "I
don't love you one bit, so there! You are ungodly
and I wish the ungodly would be overthrown, I do.
I wish the peril that walketh at night would encompass
you round about. I don't believe David
had any more troubles than I have, when he wrote
his psalms." She sat gloomily nursing her misery
and feeling herself a much abused person when she
was aroused by some one calling softly under her
window: "Nannie, Nannie."</p>

<p>She looked out and there stood Jack. "I've
saved my cake for you," she said. "How shall I
get it up to you?"</p>

<p>"I'll let down a string," said Nan promptly.
This was a pleasant diversion and she hunted around
energetically till she found in Miss Sarah's work-basket
a spool of strong thread. To the end of this
she fastened an empty spool which she dropped out
of the window. Jack fastened her cake to the
string having first wrapped it in a piece of paper,
and Nan drew it up. "You are a darling," she
called down. "I'll do as much for you some time.
Can't you get me some biscuits or something?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>
<p>"There aren't any biscuits left to-night. The
boys were so hungry and Phil was here; there's only
batter-bread left and that's too soft," returned Jack.
But here the opening of a door sent her scudding
away and Nan closed her window.</p>

<p>She devoured every crumb of the cake and longed
for more. It seemed but to whet her appetite and
she pondered long trying to devise some way by
which she could undertake a foraging expedition.
"As if I hadn't a right to my own mother's food,"
she said, complainingly. "I'm going to get it some
way."</p>

<p>After a long time given to planning out different
schemes Nan at last hit upon one which
she determined to carry out. She would wait till
after every one had gone to bed. She wondered if
she could keep awake till then. She made up her
mind that she would, and, after lighting the lamp,
she took a magazine from her aunt's stock of papers
and began to read. She grew very drowsy after
awhile, but she did not give up to sleep. Instead
she tried all sorts of steps, making such a noise that
the other children came to see what she was doing.</p>

<p>"What are you up to?" called Mary Lee through
the key-hole.</p>

<p>"I'm only amusing myself," returned Nan. "I'm
just dancing to keep awake."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why don't you go to bed?" asked Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"Don't want to yet," replied Nan, smiling.</p>

<p>Her lively effort had the effect she wished and she
was wide awake even when Aunt Sarah came up to
bed. She waited till she was sure all was still in
the house, putting out her light and watching till the
crack of light coming from the room across the hall
was no longer shining under the door. Then she
lighted her own candle and cautiously unlocked a
door leading from the room she was in to the unused
wing of the house. She left the door open
and stepped out into the dark empty hall. It appeared
strange and uncanny. A sudden squeak and
a scuttling sound suggested mice, and the whir of
wings and the quick swoop of a bat's wing scared
her so that she nearly dropped her candle. The peculiarly
musty smell which comes from a house
which has long been shut up greeted her as she
stood for a moment irresolute. Was it worth while
to continue the adventure?</p>

<p>"I just will have something to eat," she decided
plucking up courage to cross the hallway and go
down the stairs which led to the lower rooms. Her
heart beat like a trip-hammer as she continued her
way, and she was thankful when she reached the
door leading to the occupied rooms. It was never
locked, for the key was lost. Jack had disposed of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>it in some mysterious way. This Nan remembered
when her eye fell on the key in the door up-stairs.</p>

<p>Once safe in the living-room, it was easy to find
her way into the kitchen and to the cupboard where
she knew she would find any remains of supper.
To her satisfaction she discovered a small pitcher of
milk, a few pieces of bread, a little dish of stewed
peaches and a section of apple pie. These she carried
over to the table and sat down to make a hearty
supper. The lateness of the hour, for it was after
eleven o'clock, put an extra edge upon her appetite
and she ate heartily, stopping to wash the dishes
and pile them up neatly on the table.</p>

<p>Lady Gray, who occupied the kitchen at night,
that she might scare away any mice, arose from her
box and came purring toward her. "I will take
you back with me; you'll be lots of company," said
Nan, "and you can sleep at the foot of my bed;
you'll love to do that."</p>

<span class="caption">She Gave a Bound From Nan's Arms</span>
</div>



<p>She lifted the cat, who put her paws over the
girl's shoulder contentedly. She had been used to
this method of being carried about from the time she
was a kitten and was quite satisfied. All went
well till the door of the living-room was closed after
them, and Nan was mounting the stairs on her way
back to her room. She was more than half way up
when the sudden appearance of a mouse darting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>across the hall was too much for Lady Gray's equanimity.
She gave a bound from Nan's arms, the suddenness
of the spring sending the candle to the
ground, and causing Nan to miss her footing on the
stair. There was a scream, a fall, and then all was
still while Nan lay huddled up in an unconscious
heap at the foot of the stairway.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X</a><br />

<small>THE RED CLOTH</small></h2>


<p>The sound of the fall startled Aunt Sarah from a
sound sleep. She sat up in bed and listened. All
was quiet. "I couldn't have been dreaming," she
murmured. "Mary Lee, Mary Lee," she called,
"did you hear anything?"</p>

<p>"Huh?" said Mary Lee sleepily.</p>

<p>"Did you hear something fall? I thought I heard
a scream and a fall. Is Jean in bed with you?"</p>

<p>Mary Lee was now awake. "Yes, Aunt Sarah,
she's here," she answered. "I don't know whether
I heard anything or not, I was so sound asleep."</p>

<p>Miss Sarah lay down again, but her ears were open
to the slightest noise and in a little while she heard a
plaintive meow. Again she sat up. "I hear a
cat," she said. "It's somewhere near-by, and I shut
Lady Gray in the kitchen myself."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's on the porch roof," said Mary Lee,
drowsily.</p>

<p>Miss Sarah arose and went to the window which
overlooked the porch. "Scat!" she said, putting
out her head. She waited a few moments but there
was no sound from this quarter. When she drew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>in her head the meowing sounded more plainly
than ever.</p>

<p>"It certainly is in the house," said Miss Sarah.
She went to the door leading out into the hall and
discovered that the sound seemed to come from one
of the rooms opposite. In one of these slept the
boys; the other was where she had turned the key
upon Nan. Slipping on a dressing gown and slippers,
and taking a candle, she went forth to investigate.
She stopped first at the door where the
Gordon boys slept; all was still. At Nan's door she
listened. It was plain that the meowing came from
there. Lady Gray having failed of catching the
mouse had found her way into the room which
Nan had left and was trying to make it known that
she wished to be let out.</p>

<p>Miss Sarah opened the door and was met with
every evidence of satisfaction by Lady Gray. "How
in the world did you get up here?" asked Miss
Sarah in surprise. But just then a curious damply
smelling air arrested her attention and she perceived
the door standing ajar. "Of all things!" she exclaimed
and went on with her candle. "Nan," she
called, "Nan, what prank is this? I wonder if that
willful child really has run off to her grandmother's."
She cautiously went on to the stairs,
shading her candle with one hand and peering down
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>into the dark hallway. A white heap at the foot of
the stairs caught her eye. She hurried down to find
Nan, pale and still, lying there.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, dear, dear," cried Miss Sarah, "what
has happened? Nan! Nan!" but Nan did not stir.</p>

<p>Unable to carry both Nan and the candle, Miss
Sarah hastened back to her room. "Mary Lee,
Mary Lee!" she called, "get up quick and bring a
candle! Hurry!"</p>

<p>At this peremptory summons, Mary Lee leaped
from her bed. "What is the matter? What is it?"
she cried.</p>

<p>"Nan has fallen down the stairs. Come right
along. Here, take both candles and I'll carry her."</p>

<p>Trembling, Mary Lee followed apprehensively,
and lighted the way for her aunt to bear the helpless
burden up-stairs to the room from which the girl
had escaped. As Mary Lee caught sight of the
white face and limp form, she burst into tears.
"Oh, is she dead? Is she dead?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I don't know," said Miss Sarah, her lips quivering.
"Run get me some camphor, or hartshorn
or smelling salts, or, better yet, there is a little
brandy in the medicine closet; bring that."</p>

<p>"I'll bring them all," answered Mary Lee, rushing
away and coming back laden with bottles. "Oh,
Aunt Sarah," she said, anxiously watching her aunt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>force the brandy between the shut lips, "suppose
she is dead! Suppose she is, and I called her an
angle-worm. Oh, my dear Nan! My poor Nan!
What will mother say?"</p>

<p>"Hush up," cried Aunt Sarah, tortured beyond
forbearance. "I reckon you're not the only one
who is feeling distressed. She's coming around,
Mary Lee," she said presently, "but I can't tell
whether there are any bones broken or not. We'd
better get the doctor at once. Her right arm looks
queer to me. Call Randolph and send him for
Dr. Woods."</p>

<p>Aroused by the confusion, Jack came pattering to
the door. "What is the matter?" she called as
she heard Mary Lee knocking on the boys' door.</p>

<p>"Nan's fallen down the stairs," said Mary Lee,
concisely.</p>

<p>"Is she dreadfully hurt? Oh, Mary Lee, is she?"</p>

<p>"We don't know, but we are going to send for
the doctor."</p>

<p>Jack rushed across to where Nan was lying. "Go
right back to bed," commanded Aunt Sarah. "I
don't want a case of croup. I've got about as much
as I can manage right here."</p>

<p>"I want to see my Nan."</p>

<p>"Go to bed," ordered Miss Sarah, and Jack sobbingly
obeyed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>
<p>Mary Lee returned with the report that Randolph
would go instantly. She poured out some of the
brandy and came close to the bed to see Nan opening
her eyes.</p>

<p>"She was stunned," said Aunt Sarah. "No, she
mustn't have any liquor; it will be bad for her now.
She is gaining consciousness."</p>

<p>Nan gave a weak moan. "What's the matter?"
she said faintly. "My arm hurts so. Where's
mother?"</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah's chin quivered and her eyes filled as
she answered, "You've had a fall, child. Keep
quiet till the doctor comes."</p>

<p>Nan closed her eyes and lay still for a moment.
Presently she said: "I was hungry and I went down
to get something to eat." Then she fainted again
and Aunt Sarah was busy with restoratives when
the doctor came. He was a bluff, hearty, middle-aged
man who had known Nan all her life.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" he said. "Tumbling down
stairs in the dead of night? Walking like a ghost
in shut up places? What does this mean, Miss
Nan?"</p>

<p>Nan tried to smile but felt herself slipping off into
an unreal world while the doctor looked her over.
"Nothing worse than a broken arm," he decided,
"only a simple fracture, fortunately." The bone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>was slipped into place, causing a moment of exquisite
agony, and after leaving a soothing potion,
the doctor said, "She will be feverish and possibly
a little delirious after her fall. I will come again in
the morning." He departed leaving Miss Sarah to a
solitary vigil while Nan moaned and wandered off
again into the world of unreality.</p>

<p>Toward morning she began to mutter about
strange things of which Aunt Sarah had never
heard: the Poppy Fairy and Giant Pumpkin-Head,
the Place o' Pines and the red cloth. Then she
tried to sing a little song beginning: "A little child
goes wandering by." At this the tears started to
Aunt Sarah's eyes and she busied herself in putting
iced cloths on the burning head.</p>

<p>Sunday morning dawned softly bright, a dim
haze over the purple mountains and a faint mist
enveloping the valley. Mary Lee awoke with the
realization that something distressful had happened.
She told the twins to keep very quiet for Nan was
very sick, and it was a sober little group which
gathered around the breakfast table.</p>

<p>Randolph and Ashby tiptoed about cautiously.
Jean took refuge with Unc' Landy and Jack established
herself just outside the door of the room
where Nan lay. Mary Lee rushed down to Cousin
Mag's with the woeful tale and Cousin Mag hurried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>back with her offers of help. She insisted upon
taking Aunt Sarah's place and allowing her to rest,
but this Aunt Sarah would not permit.</p>

<p>"I reckon I am more responsible for this than
any one else is, Margaret," she said. "I was in a
perfect pepper-jig of a temper because Nan went
over to Uplands, and when she answered me back
pretty saucily I was madder at that than anything,
so I made her go without her supper and locked her
up into the bargain. We're both of us pretty well
punished and I reckon it's going to be my only
consolation to nurse her."</p>

<p>Cousin Mag then declared that the twins should
stay at her house a few days and she would see to
it that the housekeeping went on smoothly at the
Corners'. "You'll have to take some rest," she
declared, "and I will come over every day to see
that you get it."</p>

<p>So began the long siege for Aunt Sarah and Nan,
each of whom was receiving a punishment not anticipated.
Because she felt herself partly to blame,
Aunt Sarah was tenderness itself, and for the same
reason Nan was a docile patient.</p>

<p>Jean was perfectly willing to spend a week at
Cousin Mag's and rather liked the idea, but Jack at
first rebelled, and only after receiving the promise
that she should see Nan every day was she willing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>to go. So every afternoon a wistful little face appeared
at Nan's door.</p>

<p>It was on the third day that Nan first noticed her.
After her fever and delirium, she lay weak and exhausted,
but she gave a faint smile of welcome to
her little sister. Aunt Sarah had stepped from the
room for a minute and Jack ventured inside.
"Can't I do something for you? May I kiss you
just once, Nannie?" she said softly.</p>

<p>"Yes indeed," said Nan, and Jack dropped a
gentle kiss upon her cheek.</p>

<p>"Have you seen the red cloth?" asked Nan with
as much anxiety in her voice as her weakness would
allow.</p>

<p>"Oh, I haven't looked," said Jack, "but I will."
Aunt Sarah's footsteps were heard in the hall and
Jack slipped out. "I kissed her," she said facing
Aunt Sarah at the door, "but I didn't make
her worse." Aunt Sarah smiled but made no reply.</p>

<p>Jack went out into the hall. She had found
something to do for Nan. She tiptoed down-stairs
and went out upon the porch softly closing
the door behind her and looking toward Uplands.
Yes, there hung the red cloth from the second story
window. For a moment the child stood irresolute,
then she started off, but with more than one backward
look. She was doing the same thing as that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>for which Nan had been punished, but she didn't
care. It was for Nan. Nan wanted her Aunt Helen
to know that she could not come to her. She remembered
that this had distressed her sister in their
talk that evening before the imprisonment.</p>

<p>The little girl trudged on downhill, across the
brook and uphill, on the other side. In a few minutes
she had reached the house and was trying to
make up her mind at which door she should knock.
She decided upon that which opened upon the front
porch and here she raised the brass knocker and let
it fall twice. The door was opened by Miss Helen
herself. Jack knew her at once from Nan's description,
and it may be that Miss Helen guessed Jack's
identity for she said: "Come in, dear."</p>

<p>"I can't come in," said Jack. "Nan's tumbled
down-stairs and has broken her arm. She can't
come to see you and she's dreadful sorry."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, oh, dear, how grieved I am to hear
that!" said Miss Helen. "How did it happen?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Sarah shut her up and wouldn't give her
any supper, so she got up in the night and Lady
Gray saw a mouse and jumped so the candle went
out and Nan fell nearly all the way from the top.
It's a wonder she wasn't killed, Cousin Mag says."</p>

<p>Just what Lady Gray had to do with the accident
Miss Helen could not clearly understand. "Oh, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>am so sorry," she repeated. She hesitated before
asking, "Why did Aunt Sarah shut her up?"</p>

<p>Jack did not reply at once. "I don't believe I
ought to tell that," she said. Then after some consideration
of the subject: "Maybe I can tell half;
she shut her up for one thing and she made her go
without her supper because Nan sassed her back."</p>

<p>Miss Helen smiled but immediately she said
gravely, "Nan should not have done that."</p>

<p>"Maybe you would, too, if you were doing something
your mother let you do and your mother's
aunt said you shouldn't," returned Jack, feeling that
in this rather mixed-up speech she had adequately
excused Nan, and Miss Helen read the meaning sufficiently
well to take in the fact that Miss Sarah had
disapproved of Nan's coming to Uplands.</p>

<p>"Aunt Sarah has written to mother," said Jack,
"and Mary Lee has written, too, so I reckon Aunt
Sarah will feel awfully sorry when mother's letter
comes and says Nan wasn't disobeying." Jack
gave further enlightenment. "I see Nan every
day," she added.</p>

<p>"I am sure that makes Nan happier," returned
Miss Helen. "Which of the twins are you? Jack,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am Jack. Jean is over to Cousin Mag's.
We sleep there now while Nan is sick. Nan won't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>be able to write for ever so long, for her right arm
is all wrapped up in something and she can't move
it. It is funny that it is her right arm and her writing
arm, too, isn't it? I must go now."</p>

<p>"I wish you could stay," said Miss Helen wistfully.
"I will write to Nan, and you must give her
my love. Can't you stay and see your grandmother?
She is asleep now, for she is very tired, but she will
waken soon."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can't stay," said Jack who had no
great desire to see a grandmother of whom she had
heard from Mary Lee and Unc' Landy only ill reports.
"I saw the red cloth. Nan told me about it,"
Jack went on. "I came over to tell you about her.
She doesn't know I came but she'll be glad."</p>

<p>"You love Nan very much, don't you?" said
Miss Helen tenderly.</p>

<p>"Yes. I love Jean 'cause she's my twin, but Nan
always takes up for me and helps me out of scrapes.
I get into a great many," sighed Jack. "Maybe I'm
in one now," she added thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I hope not," Miss Helen hastened to
say. "I must not keep you if you ought not to
stay. You must not be disobedient if any one has
forbidden your coming here."</p>

<p>"Nobody did 'zackly, but&mdash;I reckon I'd better not
stay."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Helen stooped to kiss her. "I hope to see
you soon again," she said, "and I am very much
obliged to you for telling me about Nan."</p>

<p>Jack trudged back satisfied at having done her
errand. If Aunt Sarah discovered it she said nothing
and a day later came a letter from Mrs. Corner
in reply to Miss Sarah's. In it she said: "I feel
now, dear Aunt Sarah, that I did wrong in harboring
any ill-will toward Helen. I am sure my dear
husband would wish me to meet any advances from
her with an equally forgiving spirit and I do want
my children to see and love their Aunt Helen, the
only sister of their father. So Nan has my permission
to go to Uplands when she receives an invitation.
When one feels that the waves from the
dark river may perhaps soon be touching her feet,
quarrels and dissensions seem very petty things. I
realized this when I first knew of the danger
threatening me. Now that I feel that I am permitted
a longer lease of life the bitterness of the past is
something to be forgotten. I view life with a new
understanding and I would encourage peace, forgiveness
and forbearance."</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah read the letter thoughtfully, Nan
watching her with big eyes looking from a very
white little face. Aunt Sarah put her head back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>against the back of the big chair in which she was
sitting and rocked silently for some moments.</p>

<p>"What does mother say?" asked Nan feebly.</p>

<p>"She says you may go to Uplands. Would you
like to start now, Nan?" Aunt Sarah spoke half
sadly, half jestingly. "Well, Nan," she went on,
"I reckon we are both punished pretty thoroughly,
you for your sauciness and I for my hardness.
Neither of us has any scores to pay that I see.
Goodness, child, when I picked you up from the
foot of those stairs I would have given my right
hand to have taken back my conduct toward you."</p>

<p>"I was dreadfully saucy, Aunt Sarah," said Nan.
"It was wicked for me to speak so to you, and I
had no business, either, to sneak down into the
kitchen in the middle of the night. I have given
my right hand, for a little while," she added, "only
it don't do away with what I said and did."</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah bent over and kissed the child's forehead.
Two salt tears trickled down from her eyes
and fell on Nan's cheek. Those drops washed out
all ill feeling between them, for Nan understood that
Aunt Sarah did really love her and that she, too, had
suffered, if not bodily pain, at least bodily fatigue
and much mental anguish on Nan's account.</p>

<p>There was another letter which came later to Nan.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>It was not exactly a lecture, and the reproof was
slight, but after reading it Nan felt that in being impertinent
to her aunt she had abused her mother's
trust and had hurt her as well as Aunt Sarah, so she
resolved that never, never again, no matter what,
would she treat Aunt Sarah with disrespect.</p>

<p>Many were the attentions showered upon the
little girl during her illness, but chief among them,
and most pleasing to her, were those which came
from Uplands. Not a day passed that she did not
receive some token of her Aunt Helen's thought of
her. Lovely flowers were never suffered to fade
before they were replaced by others. Dainties to
tempt her palate followed the flowers, and when
she could sit up came packages of picture postal
cards of different places in Europe or interesting
photographs. To these were added once in a while
a cheerful story-book or a magazine, so, in spite of
pain and lack of freedom, Nan fared well and in due
time was out again, her arm in a sling and herself a
little pale, but otherwise no worse for her accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a><br /><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>



<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI</a><br />

<small>GRANDMOTHER</small></h2>


<p>The November winds had swept the leaves from
the maples and had sent them in hurrying gusts
upon the waters of the little brook before Nan again
visited Uplands. The oak trees still showed patches
of dark red foliage and in Place o' Pines were heaps
of shining brown brought there by that same
November wind. Since Jack had braved her Aunt
Sarah's displeasure with no ill results, Nan had felt
there was hope that she would be permitted to make
a visit to Uplands as soon as she should be well
enough. Jack had not repeated her visit; she was
not as ready to meet her grandmother as Nan was,
nor were Mary Lee and Jean any more eager, so that
the first interview was left to Nan.</p>

<p>It was one day in November that she said rather
timidly to her Aunt Sarah: "Don't you think I
might go over to Uplands? You know mother said
I might."</p>

<p>"Assuredly," replied Miss Sarah. "Go by all
means."</p>

<p>Nan looked at her critically to see if she meant
this sarcastically, but there was no suspicion of any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>such intention, and she realized that the consent was
readily given.</p>

<p>It was an important event to the girl. She had
fallen in love with the lady of the portrait in the first
place; her Aunt Helen had completely won her in
the second, and she had learned to give at least pity
and sympathy where her sisters felt, at the most,
indifference, so she set out upon her walk with an
eager anticipation.</p>

<p>She panted a little as she reached the top of the
hill on the other side of the brook, for she had not
gone so far since her accident, and, moreover, her
heart was beating fast. She was to meet her grandmother.
Would she be haughty and distant or kind
and cordial? Would she come sweeping in all
jewels and lace, or would she wear the plainer dress
which her daughter adopted? Nan hoped that she
would wear nothing more sombre than black satin
with fine laces and that she would have more than
one glittering ring upon her fingers.</p>

<p>There were no weeds now to wade through for
the lawn was smoothly mown, though grass would
have to be sown when the stubble was ploughed
under. There were pretty curtains in all the rooms
and flower-pots holding blossoming plants stood in
a row in some of the windows. A bird-cage, too,
hung in the library and as Nan stepped upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>porch she heard the joyous song of the canary. The
place seemed so lived in; no longer a mysterious
enchanted castle but the comfortable abode of human
kind. A neat maid opened the door and ushered
Nan into the library. An open fire was blazing in
the grate, the canary was singing blithely above the
blossoming geraniums and begonias. There were
magazines and papers piled on the table and an open
desk showed that some one lately had been writing
there.</p>

<p>Presently there was a rustle of skirts on the stairs
and Miss Helen came swiftly in. "My dear, my
dear!" she exclaimed. "How glad I am to see you.
What a siege you have had. It has seemed such a
long time and mother has been hoping every day
that you would be well enough to come. Do you
still suffer, poor little lass?"</p>

<p>"Not now," was the answer, "but I gave my
right hand, you see, and didn't get anything for it
after all."</p>

<p>"You haven't given it altogether, I hope."</p>

<p>"No, but I can't even write, and if I had a piano
I couldn't play on it."</p>

<p>"But you will soon be well," returned her aunt.
"Come, let us go up to mother; she is very impatient
to see you."</p>

<p>Nan followed to the softly carpeted, upper front
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>room. No grand dame, magnificently attired came
forward to meet her, but by the window sat a
little old lady in sombre mourning; her face was
lined with sorrow and her hands were worn and
thin; only a plain gold ring adorned the left
one.</p>

<p>"And this is Nancy," she said. "Excuse my rising,
my dear, I am not very strong. Come here,
won't you?"</p>

<p>Nan approached with a feeling of disappointment.
How could any one fear sharp speeches from this
mild-mannered old lady? Where was the flashing
splendor of her eyes? Where was her proud
mien? What had become of all those qualities
which the portrait represented?</p>

<p>"Come closer, Nancy, child; I want to have a
look at you," said her grandmother. And Nan
knelt down before her. Mrs. Corner took the girl's
face between her hands and looked at her long and
earnestly. "She has Jack's eyes," she said to her
daughter.</p>

<p>Nan smiled; it pleased her to be told this.</p>

<p>"And his smile," continued her grandmother.
She took Nan's free hand and smoothed it softly.
"She has the Corner fingers, too," she went on,
"long and tapering with the filbert nails. She has
sentiment, Helen, I am sure, and she is quick but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>sensitive; loving but impatient; honest and forgiving."</p>

<p>Nan felt rather embarrassed at this summarizing of
her character, but as her grandmother leaned over
and kissed her forehead a glad light leaped to the
girl's eyes. This was not censure, but a tender interest.</p>

<p>"Your old grandmother is very glad to see you,"
Mrs. Corner went on. "I have longed for you, for
one of my son's own children, and it is a great
gratification to me to know you have no hard feelings."</p>

<p>"No, I haven't any hard feelings; neither has
mother," returned Nan gravely.</p>

<p>A little expression of pain passed over Mrs.
Corner's face and she sighed. "Never let yourself
be a wicked old woman, Nancy, to want your own
way. Be willing to share what you possess with
others. Never be jealous and suspicious and envious.
Try not to pity yourself too much and don't
think your rights are superior to those of other persons.
You will be very unhappy if you do not
learn your lesson early. The book of life holds
many hard pages and it will be handed back to you
over and over again till you have learned by heart
what is meant you should know."</p>

<p>"Now, mother," put in Miss Helen, "you are entirely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>too grave and preachy. Don't spoil Nan's
first visit by giving her the impression that she is in
a lecture-room."</p>

<p>"You are right, Helen; I should not allow myself
to be carried away to the past from the present.
Forgive me, Nancy, for being prosy and serious; your
coming awakened so many memories of things I
have tried to forget. Tell me about your mother
while Helen gets out some things I brought you
from Italy."</p>

<p>Nan's eyes sparkled. "Brought me? How
good of you," she exclaimed. She wondered what
the gifts could be and was quite overpowered when
Miss Helen came in with her arms piled high with
all sorts of packages. There were soft silks from
Sorrento, corals from Naples, strings of beads from
Venice, odd bits of jewelry from Florence, scarfs
and sashes from Rome, a quaint little hat from
Milan, embroideries, laces, knickknacks of all
kinds.</p>

<p>Nan looked at them in delighted amazement.
She had never seen so many pretty things together
before. "They're not all for me," she said.</p>

<p>"All for you, my dear," said her grandmother
with a pleased smile.</p>

<p>"But," Nan spoke earnestly, "it would be dreadfully
selfish for me to be piggy and not give the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>others anything, my sisters, you know. They'd
think I was the proud sister sure enough." Nan
looked toward her aunt and back at her grandmother.
Then she saw the mild expression disappear
and the look of the portrait came over Mrs.
Corner's face.</p>

<p>"I wish you to have them all," she said haughtily.
"Not one of the others has thought it worth while
to come to see me; but you, Nancy," her face
softened, "you sent me a kiss before you saw me."</p>

<p>"Oh, but," Nan's eyes grew starry, "you know
I am the eldest and I met Aunt Helen and they
didn't; besides, they don't understand; the twins
are too young and Mary Lee, well&mdash;she hadn't seen
Aunt Helen, you know. I thank you a thousand
times, grandmother, for being so lovely as to bring
me these things, but indeed, I'll have to be honest
and say I can't keep them all for my own self."</p>

<p>"Put them away, Helen," said Mrs. Corner
wearily. "It is only one more disappointment. I
hoped my granddaughter would be pleased."</p>

<p>The tears came to Nan's eyes. "I am pleased.
I can't tell you how much. I never saw such lovely
things, and I'm just crazy for them, but I should
feel such a mean, meany, piggish thing to keep
them all."</p>

<p>"Never mind," said Mrs. Corner with an air of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>resignation, "perhaps you will change your mind,
Nancy, after you have thought it over."</p>

<p>Nan knew perfectly well that she never would,
but she said nothing, and had the discomfort of seeing
Miss Helen carry away the things as Mrs.
Corner insisted that she should do. "She might
have left out one little string of beads," thought
Nan. But not so much as a tiny pin was allowed
her and she began to realize something of the spirit
which had antagonized her mother and which had
given her father such distress. However, she was
too proud to show her disappointment and did not
leave at once; instead she chatted pleasantly and
even kissed her grandmother good-bye.</p>

<p>Miss Helen followed her to the door. "You
must not mind mother's ways too much, Nancy,"
she said. "She will think better of it yet, and you
must consider that all she has brought you will be
really yours to do with as you like after a while.
Be patient with her, darling, if you love your Aunt
Helen. Thank you so much for coming over and
for being so dear and sweet to mother. She appreciates
even when she does not confess it. You will
come again soon, won't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," returned Nan, not quite so heartily as
she would like to have spoken. She was disappointed,
really bitterly disappointed, she confessed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>to herself. Her grandmother was no queen, but
only a faulty woman. A sad and sorrowful one, it
was true, and one willing to make an effort in
many directions to compensate for her hardness and
bitterness of former years, yet she still clung to her
imperious ways and was not ready to give up
her own way nor to allow any one to thwart her
will.</p>

<p>Nan drew a long sigh as she went down-hill. It
was not going to be as easy as she had hoped to
love her grandmother. What a delight it would
have been to display all those lovely things to the
family, to give Mary Lee that string of beautiful
blue beads and the striped Roman sash; to let Jean
and Jack choose what they liked best, and to give
even Aunt Sarah something from the splendid mass
of things, while to her mother Nan would have sent
the very best of whatever seemed suitable. It certainly
was tantalizing to have things happen this
way. However, there was still the possibility of
future possession her Aunt Helen had promised her,
and she would take comfort in that.</p>

<p>Jack was the only one who had curiosity enough
to ask questions when Nan returned. No doubt
but Miss Sarah would like to have had a full account
of Nan's visit, but she scorned to show any interest
and Mary Lee took her cue from her. "Well,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>you're back again," was the only remark she made
as Nan passed through the room.</p>

<p>"Yes, here I am," returned Nan. She felt that
she would rather not discuss her visit with either
Mary Lee or Aunt Sarah. Jack waylaid her as she
was on her way up-stairs. "Did you see our
grandmother, Nan?" she asked, "and is she a horrid
old witch?"</p>

<p>"No, she isn't that," replied Nan, "though she is
different from what I expected. She was very kind
at first, but she showed the iron hand in the velvet
glove before I came away."</p>

<p>Jack looked as if she understood. She was always
quick to take Nan's allusions.</p>

<p>"If you won't say anything to anybody, I'll tell
you all about it," said Nan.</p>

<p>Jack nodded. She could be relied upon to keep
a secret if she gave a promise, but was a very
expansive person when there was no reason for
silence. As Nan expatiated upon the glories of
the gifts that were withheld Jack grew deeply interested.</p>

<p>"And you were going to give me some, weren't
you?" she said.</p>

<p>"Of course," replied Nan.</p>

<p>"I think you were very proud and very good not
to take them," remarked Jack, meditatively, all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>while forming her own plans. "Was she so very
cross, Nan?" she asked presently.</p>

<p>"Not exactly cross, only bound to have her own
way, like some other people I know."</p>

<p>Jack laughed. "I don't suppose you listened to
her if she did say things you didn't like. That's the
way I do. I always think of something nice, like
eating ice cream or having a new doll, when any
one scolds me; it makes it lots easier," she said
philosophically. She saw no reason now why she
should not go to her grandmother's. She reasoned
that it was because no one but Nan had been to see
her that she refused gifts to the rest, and if there
was any way, not too difficult, in which she could
get a string of those beautiful beads which Nan had
described, Jack meant to do it.</p>

<p>She spent much time that afternoon laboriously
writing in her very best hand, her name upon a
card. The next day, dressed in her best, she started
to make a formal call at Uplands. She meant to be
very polite and ingratiating, and, if all went well,
she would induce Jean to go. She felt that at this
first interview it would be best that no one but herself
and her grandmother should be present, for
Jean did not know things and might say something
she should not. Although the beads were the
largest object of her motive in going, there was besides
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>a desire to gain for Nan those things which
Jack felt she ought to have.</p>

<p>At the door, she handed the maid the card upon
which was unevenly written: "Miss Jacqueline
Corner." "I have come to call on Mrs. Corner,"
she said gravely, and walked into the drawing-room
where she seated herself expectantly.</p>

<p>Curiosity, amusement and a real desire to see the
child brought Mrs. Corner down. Miss Helen was
not at home. Jacqueline arose to meet her grandmother
with her best company manners. "I am
very much pleased to meet you, Mrs. Corner," she
said. "I hope you are very well."</p>

<p>"Not so very well, though better than yesterday,"
replied the lady, seating herself.</p>

<p>"You ought to take Junipy Tar," said Jack, solicitously;
"that is what Unc' Landy takes when he
isn't well." She supposed this a remedy specially
fitted to the needs of the aged.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner thanked her, smilingly, her amusement
increasing.</p>

<p>"Did you have a pleasant journey?" asked Jack,
racking her brain for a proper subject.</p>

<p>"You mean across the ocean? Only fairly so.
I am not a very good sailor."</p>

<p>Jack looked at her in surprise. "Oh," she said,
"I didn't know ladies ever were sailors, and I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>sure they would never make good ones; their skirts
must get so in the way when they climb the ropes.
I suppose you never went up as far as the main-top-gallant
mast."</p>

<p>"No, never," returned Mrs. Corner, laughing outright.
Jack could not understand her amusement
and changed the subject.</p>

<p>"Do you like dogs?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Very much."</p>

<p>"We have one; his name is Trouble. We like
him but Ran says he wouldn't take a prize at a
bench show. I don't see why dogs should take
prizes at bench shows; I should think it would be
only benches, the biggest bench or the prettiest
bench or the one made by the youngest child like
they give prizes at the fair. Don't you love fairs?
I do. I like the pink lemonade best of all and the
prize packages of candy. Once I got a real sure
enough diamond ring, but it was too big for me
and I lost it. Jean likes the pop-corn and the gingerbread
the best. What do you like?"</p>

<p>"I think," said Mrs. Corner, "that I like seeing
the people as well as anything."</p>

<p>"I do sometimes, but I don't always. Once we
all went to the circus and Jean dropped her hat between
the benches. I crawled under to get it, and
every time I tried to get out some one stepped on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>my head; I thought I'd have to stay there forever.
It was awful."</p>

<p>"It must have been."</p>

<p>"Is it ten minutes yet? I don't suppose I ought
to stay more than ten minutes at a first call, ought
I? Cousin Polly says that is long enough."</p>

<p>"I think persons often do stay longer." Mrs.
Corner was too greatly entertained to want to get
rid of her guest. "I am sure I shall be delighted if
you will stay," she went on as she rose to ring the
bell. "Bring some cake and some of that currant
shrub that Mrs. Southall sent me," she told the maid,
and Jack was glad she had mentioned the pink lemonade.
"I want to offer you some refreshment,
Miss Jacqueline," said her grandmother.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Jack, promptly sitting down
again. "Nobody ever calls me Jacqueline; it's
always Jack. When Nan and I are grown we are
going to call ourselves Nannette and Jacqueline, not
Nan and Jack, but mother says she wants me always
to be called Jack after my father. He was
your son, wasn't he?"</p>

<p>The amused look faded from Mrs. Corner's eyes.
"He was my only son and no one can take his
place. No one knows how terribly I miss him."</p>

<p>"Well," said Jack, forgetting to be propitiatory,
and somehow resenting this speech, "I'm sure we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>couldn't ever get a new father any more than you
could get a new son, and I reckon my mother
misses him as much as you do."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner looked startled. "I suppose so; I
suppose so," she murmured. "It is true that others
have claims."</p>

<p>Jack did not quite take this in but she followed
up her speech by adding: "I suppose you missed
your husband when he died, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, child, child, what are you saying?" said
her grandmother in a tremulous voice.</p>

<p>Jack regretted this remark seeing her grandmother's
agitation. "I don't suppose I ought to have
said that. Was it impolite?" she asked. "I
wanted to be very polite."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Oh, because I&mdash;&mdash;" she hesitated. "I must go
now. I have finished the party; it was very nice
indeed."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner looked at her with sudden suspicion.
"Did Nancy send you over here?" she said.</p>

<p>"Nobody sent me. I didn't tell any one I was
coming."</p>

<p>"Why did you come then?"</p>

<p>"Why to see you. Didn't the servant tell you?
Didn't she give you my card?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes." Mrs. Corner's face cleared. "I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>glad you came of your own accord. I have enjoyed
your call immensely."</p>

<p>"Thank you. Ought I to say Mrs. Corner or
grandmother?"</p>

<p>"Grandmother would please me best."</p>

<p>"Then, good-bye, grandmother. I've had a
charming time."</p>

<p>"Then, please come again."</p>

<p>"I'd be delighted, I'm sure." Her company manners
were in full swing, and she went out after a
gracious smile and bow.</p>

<p>"The droll little creature!" exclaimed Mrs. Corner.
"I must tell Helen about her. I want to
know them all. They interest me." So Jack's call
was not without effect.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII</a><br />

<small>NUTS</small></h2>


<p>With her usual compliance, Jean consented to go
to call upon her grandmother though Mary Lee obstinately
refused to make any overtures. Children
often have very strong prejudices and are even more
determined in their refusal to give them up than are
their elders. Mary Lee felt quite virtuous in her decision
not to make friends with her relatives and
often berated Nan for having no backbone and for
influencing Jack. Jean, however, had been won over
by her twin who descanted upon the deliciousness
of the refreshments offered her and upon the pretty
things their grandmother might give them.</p>

<p>"You see," said Jack to Jean in arguing the matter,
"we must be polite to our elders, Aunt Sarah
says, and I think we ought to be very, very nice to
our grandmother because she is old. I shouldn't
wonder if she were the oldest person we know."</p>

<p>"Not as old as Unc' Landy," said Jean.</p>

<p>"No, of course not; he is older than anybody, but
he doesn't count," returned Jack.</p>

<p>"I think we might take grandmother one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>kittens," said Jean with sudden inspiration. Lady
Gray had recently given them the surprise of a family
of four lovely kittens. Aunt Sarah had said most
positively that they could keep only one, although
they had all insisted that one apiece would
exactly agree to the number, but Aunt Sarah was
firm and the two elder girls had given way to the
younger ones who had each selected the one she
preferred and now it was a matter of continual dispute
as to which was to be finally kept. A third
kitten was promised to Phil, and Mitty had declared
that she knew of a good home for the fourth.</p>

<p>"You see," said Jean, "if the kitten lived at Uplands
we could see it often. We could even borrow
it sometimes to play with ours."</p>

<p>"We'll take them both over," decided Jack, "and
let her choose one, then we won't have to quarrel
any more over them, for that will settle it."</p>

<p>They started off each with a wee, mewing kitten,
and were duly announced as Miss Jacqueline and
Miss Jean Corner, though this time their Aunt Helen
was at home and they were not ushered into the
drawing-room but into the library, and from thence
were conducted up-stairs to their grandmother's
room.</p>

<p>"Well, young ladies," said Mrs. Corner, "I am
glad to see you. So this is Jean. She looks more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>like the Lees than Nancy and Jack. What have you
there, my dears?"</p>

<p>"We have brought you a kitten," spoke up Jack.
"We brought two so you could take your choice,
for it is really very hard to tell which of them all is
the prettiest. We let Phil take his choice first and
we left the ugliest for Mitty, though that one is
really very pretty, but not quite so lovely as these."</p>

<p>"It is very kind of you to want me to have the
best," said Mrs. Corner. "Which do you consider
the prettier?"</p>

<p>"I like this one," said Jack, displaying a furry
gray ball from which issued a protesting mew as
Jack held it up.</p>

<p>"And I like this," said Jean, more discreetly holding
her kitten in her lap. "It has white feet and a
white shirt front. Jack's is all gray. Mine is named
Rubaiyat; we call it Ruby."</p>

<p>"And mine," said Jack gravely, "is Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
It's a Bible name. Baz ought to
be very good."</p>

<p>"What extraordinary names!" exclaimed Mrs.
Corner.</p>

<p>"Ruby is named after the 'Rubaiyat of a Persian
Kitten,' for Lady Gray is a Persian, you know. Ran
named them and he said we could call Jean's, Ruby,
and mine Baz. He says that Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>just suits a cat for he found out what it means and it
means 'the spoil hastens; the prey speeds.'"</p>

<p>"Helen, did you ever know such droll children?"
said Mrs. Corner laughing.</p>

<p>"Would you like to look at them closer?" said
Jack. "Their claws are very briery like blackberry
bushes, but they really don't scratch unless you
don't know how to hold them. I'll put them in
your lap and you can see how sweet and dear they
are."</p>

<p>"They certainly are beauties," said Mrs. Corner,
admiringly. "Don't you think we would enjoy
having one, Helen?"</p>

<p>"Most decidedly," said Miss Helen, "and of the
two I think Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz charms me the
most. He is a darling."</p>

<p>Jack gave a long sigh. "I just knew you'd say
that."</p>

<p>"Would you rather keep this one, then?" asked
Miss Helen.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, no," said Jean.</p>

<p>The ladies laughed. "Then suppose you don't
give either away," said Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>"We can't keep but one, you know. Aunt Sarah
said so," Jean told them. "And we'd rather you'd
have one than anybody."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>
<p>"Then we'll take the gray one gladly and are very
much obliged to you for thinking of bringing us
such a beautiful and valuable pet," Mrs. Corner told
them. "Haven't we some cake or something for
these little girls, Helen?" she asked.</p>

<p>Miss Helen thought so and they were presently
regaled upon delicious cake and some sort of curious
drink that tasted like currant jelly and mint. It was
a beautiful red color and Jack thought it was better
than the pink lemonade at the County Fair.</p>

<p>While they were eating and drinking, Miss Helen
left them to bring back to each some odd little green
dishes which she said she had found in Holland.
The children were delighted with the curiously
shaped pots and pans, the pitchers and tea-pots,
and bore them off in triumph, Jack feeling less regret
at leaving her kitten since in return she had
these queer little dishes.</p>

<p>She displayed them in high glee to Nan who was
surprised and pleased that such an interest had been
shown in her little sisters. If only Mary Lee would
not be so offish, all might be pleasant between the
two households, she thought, and&mdash;though this she
only secretly admitted&mdash;they might still share the
delights of those beautiful withheld gifts.</p>

<p>Place o' Pines was too chilly a spot to be visited
these November days, but the woods up the mountainside
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>attracted both girls and boys one Saturday
afternoon after the first frost, for Phil and Mary Lee
knew a place where nuts were plentiful, so they all
piled into the Lewis's carryall and went to where
the road ended, fastening the horses there and going
the rest of the way on foot. It was wildly beautiful
in this mountain forest. The distant call of a bird,
the rustle of leaves as some creature of the woods
sped from sight, or the trickle of some little mountain
brook was all that could be heard until the
merry laughter of the young people rang out upon
the air.</p>

<p>Nan sat down upon a log and was soon lost in a
dream. The boys fell to gathering nuts; Jack and
Jean ran here and there excited by the freedom and
wildness of the spot; Phil and Mary Lee soon discovered
a mutual interest in the lair of a Molly
Cotton-Tail and her babies and next gave chase to
a squirrel.</p>

<p>"We might find out where he lives," said Phil.
"I'd like to get a young one and train him. There
he goes, Mary Lee. Come on," and Mary Lee followed
over fallen logs, through heaps of dead leaves
and broken branches till finally Master Squirrel was
lost from view and they were a long distance from
where they started.</p>

<p>Meanwhile several bags of nuts were stowed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>away under the seat of the carryall and Randolph
discovered that it was time to start back. "The
days are so short," he said, "that we haven't time
to more than get back before dark. Call them all
in, Ashby."</p>

<p>Ashby gave a long mountain call. Jack and Jean
came running and Nan appeared from where she
had been picking up a last hoard of nuts. "Where
are the others?" asked Ran.</p>

<p>"Don't know," returned Nan.</p>

<p>"I saw them go off that way." Jack waved her
hand toward the west. Ran went a short distance
and gave the call. Then he waited. There was
utter silence save for the trickling of the little stream.
Again he called but there was no response.
"Where can they be?" he said impatiently. "They
ought to know better than to act so. I suppose
they think it is funny to pretend they don't hear."
But in a little while, he feared that it was not pretense,
and that they were really not only out of
sight but out of hearing. He did not voice his alarm
to the girls, however, but, after whistling softly for
a few minutes, he walked away, calling to his
brother.</p>

<p>"See here, Ashby," he said, "I'm afraid those
two have strayed away and have lost their bearings.
Because they have been up here a number of times,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>they think they can find their way anywhere. Now,
don't express any surprise when I propose that you
drive the others home. I'm going to stay here and
you go back and tell Colonel Lewis what I fear.
Get fresh horses and come back. I'll wait here in
case Phil and Mary Lee find their way back. It will
be all right."</p>

<p>Ashby agreed and the two came back to where
the others were waiting. "Phil's playing us a
nice trick," said Ran in assumed contempt, "and
it's time you girls were starting home. I'm going
to send you back with Ashby and I'll wait here for
the others. I'll hide so they can't see me. Won't
they be good and scared?"</p>

<p>"But how will you all get back?" asked Nan.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ashby's coming back for us. It isn't much
of a drive and Miss Sarah will be worrying. As
soon as it gets a little darker, Phil and Mary Lee will
hurry out to the road fast enough."</p>

<p>"You don't&mdash;&mdash;" Nan glanced at the twins who
had clambered into the carriage. "You don't
think," she repeated in a low whisper, "that they
could be lost."</p>

<p>"Nonsense," returned Ran. "They'll be here in
a minute, only it isn't worth while to wait for them
and they deserve a good scare."</p>

<p>Nan looked at him steadily. She was not quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>sure that he was not alarmed for the safety of the
missing two, but he smiled confidently.</p>

<p>"It's all right," he insisted.</p>

<p>"If you stay, I will," said Nan decidedly.</p>

<p>"No, you mustn't," returned Ran.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't want you," he answered bluntly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well then," said Nan, somewhat offended,
"of course, I'll not stay, but I must say you're
polite."</p>

<p>Ran turned away. He had gained his point at
the risk of being rude, but that was of little moment
just then. He could make his apologies later. And
so the three girls drove off with Ashby as attendant
and left Randolph to keep a lonely watch on the
mountain.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah was on the lookout for the nutting
party. "Where are the others?" was her first
question.</p>

<p>Nan explained. "Ran thought we'd better come
on," she said. "He's waiting for Phil and Mary
Lee. Ashby is going back for them."</p>

<p>"Gracious!" exclaimed Aunt Sarah and sought
out Ashby.</p>

<p>When she returned Nan was quick to read the anxiety
in her face. "You don't think they could
really be lost," she said in alarm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span></p>
<p>"We'll wait and see," returned Aunt Sarah in her
most non-committal manner.</p>

<p>But as the hours wore on, she made no secret of
her fears. Jean went to bed weeping. Jack's eyes
had a scared look in them. Just suppose there
should be bears and wildcats in the woods. She
put her question to Nan. "Aren't there wild
animals on the mountain?" she asked. "Landy
says so."</p>

<p>"Of course, there are wild animals; foxes and
rabbits and chipmunks," Nan answered lightly,
trying to allay her fears.</p>

<p>"I don't mean those. I mean real tearing,
scratching, eating animals," said Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know, I don't know," returned Nan,
ready to break down herself. "Don't think about
it, Jack. Go to sleep and in the morning you will
see Mary Lee safe and sound in bed asleep."</p>

<p>"Please stay with me then till I go to sleep," said
Jack. "I see all sorts of things in the dark." And
Nan stayed.</p>

<p>About nine o'clock Aunt Sarah put on her wraps.
"I'm going over to Mag's," she said. "I can't
stand this."</p>

<p>"Please let me go, too," pleaded Nan.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah waited a moment before she consented,
and the two set off together, leaving Mitty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>and Unc' Landy to keep a sleepy watch in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, night had descended upon the mountain.
Feeling that danger actually threatened his
little son, Colonel Lewis provided himself with
lanterns, warm wraps, food and a bottle of spirits,
and then started with Ashby to the spot where Ran
waited.</p>

<p>It was dark by the time the carriage appeared and
Ran called out: "That you, Ashby?"</p>

<p>"Colonel Lewis and I," replied Ashby. "Are
you all there, Ran?"</p>

<p>"I'm all here, but nobody else," returned Ran not
meaning to be jocular.</p>

<p>"They haven't come?" Colonel Lewis asked
making his way quickly to the spot.</p>

<p>"No, sir. Don't you think it would be a good
plan to build a fire? They might see it, or they
might see the smoke."</p>

<p>"If there is no danger of the woods catching we
can do it."</p>

<p>"There's a big rocky place further on where I
think it would be safe," Ran told him. "I have
kept up a constant calling, but haven't heard a sound
except from an owl."</p>

<p>To build the fire was the first step and Ashby was
left to watch it while the other two set out, lanterns
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>in hand, taking the direction in which the wanderers
had disappeared. "I always carry a small compass,"
said Colonel Lewis, "and I have hunted in these
mountains since I was a boy. We'll keep an eye on
the smoke and then if we can only find those children,
I shall have no fears about our getting back to
the fire. You're not afraid, Ashby?" he called
back.</p>

<p>"No, sir," came the prompt reply.</p>

<p>"Keep up a good fire and a good heart," called
Ran.</p>

<p>"All right, I will," and little Ashby had his
turn of loneliness. It must be confessed that he did
feel a sinking of heart as he saw the two disappear
into the darkness of the forest.</p>

<p>Darker, more lonesome, more awful did that
forest seem to the two children who, wearied at last
from unsuccessful attempts to find their way back,
sat down upon a log to rest. "It's no use trying
any more," said Phil. "We're tuckered out and we
can't see a yard ahead of us anyhow. It wasn't
right for me to bring you way off here, Mary Lee,
and I wish I hadn't done it."</p>

<p>"It wasn't your fault any more than mine," said
she. "We both started to follow the squirrel."</p>

<p>"Yes, but I said I wanted to try to catch a young
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>one, and so you went to accommodate me. If I
hadn't said that you wouldn't have gone."</p>

<p>"We might have gone after something else just
the same," said the girl. "It is awfully dark, isn't
it, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Father always carries a compass." Phil was
busy with his own thoughts. "I wish we knew
the direction we came, then I could find the
North star and go by that."</p>

<p>"But we can scarcely see the stars in here."</p>

<p>"Anyhow I ought to have noticed the direction.
Father says that is what one ought always to do
when he is in a strange place, especially in the
woods."</p>

<p>"It's getting very cold," said Mary Lee, plaintively.
"Do you suppose we could kindle a fire by rubbing
two sticks together as the Indians do?"</p>

<p>"It wouldn't do to have a fire here if we had
matches. We might set the woods on fire. We
ought to get out into some open place to do that."</p>

<p>"Couldn't we find one?"</p>

<p>"It's warmer here, more sheltered, you know.
Are you very cold, Mary Lee? Take my coat."</p>

<p>"I'll do no such thing," Mary Lee refused determinedly.
"It's no colder for me than for you."</p>

<p>"Then let's sit close." So the two cousins snuggled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>together, each feeling comfort from the nearness
of the other.</p>

<p>"I wish we had something to eat," sighed Mary
Lee after a silence. "It will be a long time before
morning. Shall you dare to go to sleep, Phil?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;don't know."</p>

<p>"Do you suppose they will try to find us?"</p>

<p>"My father will, I know."</p>

<p>"What are you thinking about?" said Mary Lee
after another long pause.</p>

<p>"I'm trying to puzzle out about directions. Of
course, the mountain is west of the town, for the
sun sets behind it, so we ought to go east to get
back, and we must go down-hill instead of up."</p>

<p>"But we might go down-hill and go north or
south."</p>

<p>"When the sun rises, we can see that and travel
toward the east."</p>

<p>"We can do that unless&mdash;&mdash;" Mary Lee's courage
was beginning to ooze out and she gave a little
frightened sob.</p>

<p>"What, Mary Lee?" Phil began to stroke her
hand in boyish fashion.</p>

<p>"Unless the bears or wildcats get us before then,"
she sobbed outright.</p>

<p>Phil had thought of this, but had not mentioned
it. "They shall not get us," he declared. "They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>are not going to. Father will find us before
long."</p>

<p>"How can he?"</p>

<p>"He can, and he will," said Phil confidently.
"Father can do anything he sets out to do."</p>

<p>This was somewhat comforting, though it did
not keep out the cold which was growing more and
more evident every moment and presently both
children were shivering.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," said Mary Lee, "that if we
covered ourselves with leaves like the Babes in the
Woods that we would be warmer?"</p>

<p>"We might try it," said Phil. "The leaves are
good and dry and there are lots around us right
here."</p>

<p>They began to feel around them and to scrape up
the fallen leaves, the exercise helping them to keep
warm. They kept close together, fearing lest one
should be separated from the other and not be able
to find the way back. They sat down in their nest
of leaves and pulled them high around them.</p>

<p>"I know now how the woodsy things feel," said
Mary Lee, cheered by the warmth. "They sleep
under a blanket of leaves all winter and peep out
again in the spring. I'm getting sleepy, Phil."
She rested her head against the log and was soon
asleep.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p>Phil piled the leaves over her till she was almost
hidden by them, but for him there was no sleep,
for afar off the wailing cry of a wildcat he heard
and recognized. Presently, it sounded nearer and
the boy in terror, crouched down in the leaves by
his sleeping companion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII</a><br />

<small>TROUBLE FINDS THEM</small></h2>


<p>After all, it was not Colonel Lewis nor Ran who
first found the two lost ones, but that humble and
frequently despised creature, Trouble. Trouble at
whom Colonel Lewis always jeered, whom Phil
often teased, and Mary Lee abused to his face, calling
him mongrel cur while he wagged his tail in
happy unconsciousness that she was not calling him
a pet name. It was a favorite amusement of Mary
Lee's to use all sorts of uncomplimentary words in
a caressing voice when speaking to the dog, so that
Trouble would believe he was being made much of
and would respond in his best manner.</p>

<p>Nan suddenly remembered this after her return
home and she called the dog, wrote a note and tied
it around his neck, then bade him follow the carriage,
which at that time was still in sight. He understood
and obeyed gladly for he always delighted
to be one of an outgoing party. That he did not
follow them earlier in the afternoon was because
Mary Lee had driven him back when he had tried
to become one of their number. "He is always
scaring up rabbits and frightening birds when Phil
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>and I want to observe their habits," she said in excuse.</p>

<p>"Observe their habits," mocked Nan. "Do let
him go; he can follow me all he likes."</p>

<p>"That's just what he will not do," Mary Lee returned.
"He always comes with us."</p>

<p>"Because you go prowling around and I sit still,"
retorted Nan. "He's just as fond of me, I know."</p>

<p>But Mary Lee had her way and called Unc' Landy
to keep Trouble at home.</p>

<p>Colonel Lewis and Ran had already started upon
their search when Trouble sprang out of the darkness
toward the fire in front of which Ashby sat.
Greatly pleased at discovering one of the family,
Trouble nearly wagged off the hind part of his
body. That Ashby was glad to see him goes without
the saying, and the boy was glad for more than
one reason.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Trouble, come here," he said.
"You've had a long tramp, haven't you? What's
that around your neck?" He unfastened the note
which was tied to his collar. It read: "Send
Trouble after Mary Lee and Phil. He can get the
scent from their coats that we put in the carriage.
Oh, I hope he can find them. Nan."</p>

<p>Ashby ran to the carriage and dragged forth the
wraps. Quickly selecting a coat of Mary Lee's and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>one of Phil's, he held them out. "Here, Trouble,"
he said, "seek them. Find Mary Lee, Trouble."
The dog sniffed the coat, trotted off a few steps,
looked back to see if he was doing what was expected
of him, and then, with nose to the ground,
took up the scent and disappeared.</p>

<p>At this very moment, Phil was cowering in the
leaves in momentary fear of hearing the wildcat's
scream closer at hand. An owl hooting mournfully
near-by suddenly awakened Mary Lee who gave a
little shriek of terror as she realized where she was.
"I've been asleep in these dreadful lonely woods,"
she said. "How could I do it? Oh, Phil, what's
that?" For again the cry of the wildcat sounded
through the forest.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Mary Lee," said Phil. "Don't be
scared. I'll take care of you."</p>

<p>"How can you," said Mary Lee, "a boy with not
even a pistol? What can you do to a wildcat?"</p>

<p>"I'll fight it as long as I can," said Phil between
set teeth, "and you could get away anyhow. Hark!
What's that?" For there was a new sound in the
woods that was neither cry of wildcat nor hoot of
owl, but the honest and friendly bark of a dog.</p>

<p>Phil sprang to his feet.</p>

<p>"Is it&mdash;is it a wolf?" asked Mary Lee in trepidation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>
<p>"No sir-ee," cried Phil, excitedly. "It's a dog,
a sure enough dog, and, if I am not much mistaken,
it's old Trouble."</p>

<p>Mary Lee scrambled from her nest of leaves and
joined Phil in calling. "Trouble, Trouble! Hyar!
Hyar!"</p>

<p>There was a joyous yelp, a scampering over dead
leaves and presently Trouble dashed out of the
darkness toward them.</p>

<p>"Oh, Trouble, Trouble, you blessed old dear!"
Mary Lee flung her arms around the dog who could
not keep still in his joy and excitement.</p>

<p>"Listen! Look!" cried Phil. There was a faint
call in the distance, then the twinkle of a light seen
through the naked trees. Phil's mountain call was
answered and the lights came nearer and nearer.
Trouble dashed toward them barking, yelping. The
owl was silent, though they heard the soft rush of
wings overhead. The cry of the wildcat sounded
faint and far, but close at hand came a glad "Hallo!"
followed by the call of "Phil, Phil, are you safe,
boy?" And in another minute the forms of Colonel
Lewis and Ran appeared in the gleam of their lanterns
which shot long beams aslant the darkness, and
discovered Phil and Mary Lee standing in the pile
of dry leaves.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>
<p>It was a triumphant journey home and no one was
more contented than Trouble who lay snuggled by
Mary Lee's side, his head in her lap, while the slow
way was made down the mountainside.</p>

<p>It was almost midnight before the horses drew
up before the house, but a light shining from the
living-room showed that some one was still up and
watching. At the sound of the wheels Aunt Sarah
came forth and peered out.</p>

<p>"All safe," cried Ran, climbing down. He was
followed by Ashby, Mary Lee and Trouble last,
though upon this occasion not least.</p>

<p>Colonel Lewis drove away saying there was too
much anxiety at his own home for him to stop a
moment to talk.</p>

<p>After hearing particulars, and learning that they
had eaten on their way home, Aunt Sarah hustled
every one to bed, saying that rest was the
best for each one of them.</p>

<p>Nan had fallen asleep at last, but, as Mary Lee
slipped into bed beside her, she was conscious of her
presence and stretched out a hand to be sure, then
threw an arm around her sister as if to keep her
from slipping away again.</p>

<p>There was great rejoicing in the morning and Jack
was so full of the adventures of Phil and Mary Lee
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>that she could not keep her mind on her Sunday-school
lesson and heard scarce a word her teacher
said.</p>

<p>Trouble was made much of and was saved so
many tid-bits from the breakfast plates that he was
in danger of an attack of indigestion. "I'll never
call him a mongrel cur again," said Mary Lee tenderly.
"If it hadn't been for him, we might never
have been found."</p>

<p>"You forget," said Randolph, with a look across
the table at Nan, "that if it hadn't been for Nan,
Trouble would never have gone in search of you,"
and then and there Nan forgave him for his rude
speech of the day before.</p>

<p>"If I hadn't come home, I would never have
thought of sending him," she acknowledged. "He
ought to have a medal, bless him."</p>

<p>"So he shall have," said Ran, and he gravely provided
a tin medal on which was scratched: "For
Heroic Service." This was fastened to the dog's
collar and it was worn proudly.</p>

<p>However much Nan may have felt that Ran had
made amends, the boy himself did not consider that
he had and came to his cousin as she was tidying up
the living-room. "Are you going to church,
Nan?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied. "I feel as if I had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>been drawn through a knot-hole this morning. Of
course, Mary Lee won't go and maybe I'll stay at
home to keep her company, though she's still asleep,
poor child."</p>

<p>"I thought if you were going I'd wait for you,"
said Ran.</p>

<p>Nan threw him a mocking smile. "I thought
you didn't care for my company," she said.</p>

<p>"That was yesterday," returned Ran. "Besides,
I didn't say I didn't want your company; I said I
didn't want you to stay up there on the mountain
and so I didn't, for I was afraid then that those two
were lost and I knew it would be harder for you
there than at home. Then I knew if we set out on
a search you couldn't go and it would not do to
leave you all alone."</p>

<p>"I realized all that afterward," Nan told him
frankly.</p>

<p>"Then we have made up," said Ran with boyish
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Of course," returned Nan. "I was miffed only
for a few minutes. I knew before we got home
that you spoke as you did so I wouldn't insist upon
staying. Still," she added, "it was hard to go off
and leave one's sister to wildcats, though I must
say Mary Lee isn't thinking much about them at
this moment, and I hope she isn't dreaming about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>them. There comes Phil, so he is all right. Mary
Lee says he was so brave and manly, little as he is."</p>

<p>Phil joined them. "Say, did any of you see my
watch?" were his first words.</p>

<p>"Why, no," replied the two. "Have you lost it,
Phil?" asked Nan.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. I must have caught the chain on
something in the woods and snapped it so the
watch fell out when I stooped over. The end of the
chain was hanging from the buttonhole when I
looked last night after I came home, but the watch
was gone."</p>

<p>"Isn't that too bad?" said Nan, sympathetically.
"You will have a hard time finding it, I am afraid."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid so. I wouldn't lose that watch for
anything, and I'm going to hunt high and low for
it."</p>

<p>"We'll all help," said Ran. "We'll organize
a search party, Phil, and go up the mountain to-morrow
afternoon."</p>

<p>"Say, that will be fine," said Phil, gratefully.
His watch was one of his dearest possessions; he
had not had it very long and was feeling very hopeless
over its loss. "I don't suppose we shall find
it," he went on, "but I'm glad to have your help in
looking for it. How's Mary Lee?"</p>

<p>"She's asleep," Nan told him. "Aunt Sarah said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>we were not to disturb her. I think she is only
worn out. You are all right, aren't you, Phil?"</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed, or I would be if I hadn't lost my
watch. They are waiting for me; I must go or I
will be late for church."</p>

<p>"I reckon I'll go," said Nan suddenly. Miss
Sarah, the twins and Ashby had gone on, and soon
Nan followed with Randolph. She was feeling
very thankful for her sister's safety, and she was
not the only one of that congregation who sent up
a silent prayer of gratitude for the deliverance of
two children from the "terror by night."</p>

<p>The next afternoon, the search party started forth
though this time Miss Sarah declared the girls should
not go, that they had not yet recovered from the effects
of their last trip. However, since Colonel
Lewis was to be their guide, and his daughter was
going, too, consent was finally given to Mary Lee,
though she was charged not to lose sight of the
older members of the party.</p>

<p>"I really don't feel as if I ought to let you go,"
said Aunt Sarah, "but, since Polly and her father will
be there, I can assume that you will be reasonably
safe."</p>

<p>"When Phil was so good to me and would have
fought the wildcat if it had attacked us, I ought to
go," said Mary Lee. "I should feel downright
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>mean not to help look for the watch. Besides, I
know where we were better than any one."</p>

<p>"Well, go along," said Aunt Sarah, "but don't
you lose sight for one minute of Polly and her
father and don't go traipsing off with Phil alone."</p>

<p>Mary Lee promised, and they set out.</p>

<p>Nan had had enough of the mountain for one
while, and besides her arm was scarce strong enough
for her to indulge in horseback riding, for it was in
this fashion that the party determined to go. The
twins were in terror of the wildcat and it was
not difficult to persuade them to remain behind.</p>

<p>A thin stream of smoke curled up above the
purple-brown trees against the blue sky as the
riders turned toward the mountain path.</p>

<p>"I wonder if that is our fire still burning," said
Mary Lee to the colonel.</p>

<p>"Hardly," he answered. "It is some cabin in the
mountain I suppose."</p>

<p>Mary Lee watched the smoke drift away across
the blue and wondered how it would seem to live
so far from neighbors. She decided that she would
not like it. They were able to penetrate much
further with their horses, and this time Colonel
Lewis's compass was put to use. When the path
became too intricate they fastened their horses and
the colonel led the way on foot, and finally reached
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>the very log where Phil and Mary Lee had rested the
night of their wanderings.</p>

<p>To their surprise, a little further on was a clearing,
and it was discovered that the path they had taken
led them to a cabin, from which came the stream of
curling smoke they had seen as they came up the
mountain. After searching all along their way and
at last scattering the leaves by the log they concluded
that they must give up the watch as irretrievably
lost, and were about to turn away when Mary Lee
saw some one watching them curiously from a little
distance off.</p>

<p>"There's somebody," she said to her Cousin Polly.
"I am going to ask if anything has been seen of the
watch."</p>

<p>"Where's anybody?" asked Polly.</p>

<p>"Over there; it is a little girl about as big as I
am."</p>

<p>"It must be Wordsworth's cottage girl," said
Polly, "for she has 'a rustic woodland air, and she
is wildly clad.' I reckon she will run if you speak to
her, Mary Lee. These mountain people are mighty
scary."</p>

<p>"Then don't you come. Maybe she won't be
afraid of a girl her own size. You stay here."</p>

<p>Polly agreed and Mary Lee went toward the girl
who did indeed show signs of alarm and looked as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>if she were about to run away when Mary Lee
called to her, "don't go, please. I want to ask
you something."</p>

<p>The girl stood her ground though she backed
away as Mary Lee came up. She was a pretty,
dark-eyed little creature with masses of light curly
hair tousled about her neck. She wore a ragged,
faded calico frock and her feet were bare.</p>

<p>"My cousin and I got lost up here Saturday
night," said Mary Lee, "and if we had known there
was a house so near we wouldn't have been so
scared. We heard a wildcat and it frightened us
nearly out of our wits."</p>

<p>The girl looked interested. Mary Lee had chosen
the proper way to approach her. "We-alls ain't
skeered of 'em," she drawled. "Maw shot one las'
week, an' she come nigh gittin' another yessaday."</p>

<p>"Maybe it was the very one that scared us. I
wish she had killed it. I wonder why we didn't
see a light in your house. That is your house,
isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, we-alls lives hyah. They wasn't no
light, 'scusin' the fiah, an' that died down arter supper.
We-alls goes to bed with the chickens."</p>

<p>"We didn't get home till nearly midnight," Mary
Lee told her, "and my, but I was tired. My cousin
and I got lost from the rest and they had a great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>time finding us. If we had only gone on a little
further, we should have come to your house,
shouldn't we?"</p>

<p>"We-alls don't come aroun' that-a-way from
town; we comes up the other side; it's a little mite
furder but it ain't so steep."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it. I wish we had known." Then
feeling that she had established a sufficient acquaintance
to put her important question she asked,
"You didn't happen to find a little watch in the
leaves, did you? My cousin lost it. He sets such
store by it and we all came up the mountain this
afternoon to help him find it."</p>

<p>For answer the girl put her hand down into the
bosom of her frock and drew forth something which
she held out in her palm. It was Phil's watch.</p>

<p>"Oh!" Mary Lee turned and called: "Polly,
Polly, it's found! it's found!" She turned to the
girl again. "Where did you find it? and please
tell me your name."</p>

<p>"My name's Daniella Boggs," said the girl, taking
a shy look at Polly Lewis who now came up.</p>

<p>Polly put out her hand and gently detained the
girl who seemed about to flee. "We are so much
obliged," she said. "My little brother was distressed
at losing his watch. Where did you
find it?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>
<p>The girl who had put one finger in her mouth,
took it out and pointed to the heap of leaves by the
log. It was evident that in stooping over to gather
them Phil had dropped the watch.</p>

<p>Colonel Lewis moved toward them but Polly
waved him off. She saw that the girl was too shy
to stand more company, and she left her with Mary
Lee, herself returning to her father. "Offer her a
reward," he said. "Of course it was very honest of
her. She could easily have said that she had seen
nothing of the watch. Here," he took a bill from
his pocketbook and handed it to Polly, "give her
this and tell her we all thank her very much."</p>

<p>Polly carried the bill to the girl. "My father and
all of us are very much obliged to you," she said,
"and we want you to take this."</p>

<p>Daniella retreated, shaking her head and putting
her hands behind her. "I don't want it," she said.
"I ain't done nothin' to earn it. 'Twa'n't no work
nor nothin'."</p>

<p>"Oh, but," Polly argued, "when people lose
things, they expect to give a reward to whoever
finds them."</p>

<p>Daniella still shook her head. "I ain't done
nothin'," she repeated. "Maw wouldn't like me to
take money."</p>

<p>"But you could spend it in town."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span></p>
<p>"Don't never go to town."</p>

<p>"But isn't there anything you would like? Your
mother could buy it for you, you know."</p>

<p>Daniella looked at the red knitted jacket which
Mary Lee wore. "I like that," she said, nodding
her head toward it.</p>

<p>"Then you shall have one just like it," said Polly,
heartily. "I will go right to work and knit it myself.
Wouldn't you like a pair of shoes for winter?
and can you read?"</p>

<p>"Maw kin. I kain't. I'd like the shoes when it
snows, but I hates to put 'em on befo' that."</p>

<p>"Then you shall have a pair all ready for the first
snow," Polly told her.</p>

<p>"I wish you would come to my home some day.
Will you, if we come for you?" asked Mary Lee,
with a missionary spirit of enlarging the girl's ideas.</p>

<p>"I'd be skeered," said Daniella.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, you wouldn't. I have three sisters and
we don't live right in the town; it's like country.
We have chickens and things."</p>

<p>"I've got some chickens," returned Daniella, "an'
I've got a pig, too. Maw wouldn't let me go to
town, I reckon, 'cause I ain't got clothes like you-uns.
She ain't no time to make 'em. She too busy
nussin' grandad. He right foolish-lak now, jest
lak a baby."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well, we'll come some day to see if your
mother will let you come to town," said Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"And I will bring you a red jacket like this."
Polly put her hand on Mary Lee's arm. "Good-bye,
Daniella. We shall not forget you."</p>

<p>Daniella smiled, but made no reply. She wondered
if she would really ever have such a beautiful
thing as that red jacket. About going to town she
was not so keen, for she had never been there in all
her short life, and, though she half longed to see its
wonders, she feared to step beyond the confines of
her own forest.</p>

<p>She watched the party ride off, but turned to run
as Phil, who declared he must thank her personally,
went toward her. Like a deer the girl fled, not
stopping till she was safe in her own cabin-home.
Her courage had stood all that one afternoon would
allow.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV</a><br />

<small>DANIELLA</small></h2>


<p>Mary Lee came home full of her afternoon's experience
and could talk of nothing but Daniella.
Accordingly, when Nan discovered that not only
Mary Lee, but her Cousin Polly, and even the boys,
showed an interest in the little mountain maid, she
felt that she was rather out of it and begged Polly
to take her up to the cabin when she should go
with the red jacket. Jack and Jean, too, were
greatly interested. Said Jean: "My Sunday-school
teacher said I must try to make something for the
church basket and that it would be sold for the
home missions, but I am going to make it for
Daniella instead, for I am sure she is a home mission,
and I would thrice as soon she would have it.
It is dreadful for any one to go barefoot in winter.
I've begun to crochet some lace and I will sell that
and buy something for Daniella." So, thereafter,
wherever Jean went, she carried her spool of thread
and her crochet needle. Her length of rather soiled,
somewhat uneven lace grew apace and she set her
hopes upon selling it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>
<p>Jack took no such industrious means of showing
her concern, unless one may consider her method
an industrious one, for she called on various of the
school children to come to a peep-show, one penny
admission. Ten girls came, and with the proceeds
Jack bought corn to pop. Nan helped her to turn
it into delectable pop-corn balls which were so
toothsome that Ran and Ashby bought most of
them, and their boy friends were customers for the
remainder, so with little labor Jack was fifty cents
to the better and serenely watched her less quick-witted
sister Jean patiently working her lace.</p>

<p>Nan and Mary Lee took a hint from Jack and conceived
the plan of having a bazaar for the benefit of
the little mountain girl. The boys fell in with the
plan; some of the schoolgirls joined them and
Cousin Polly Lewis herself offered to mother the
scheme.</p>

<p>"It is very exciting," said Nan to Mary Lee when
they had taken the first decided move. "I keep
thinking of all sorts of things to do and of people
to ask for contributions. Do you suppose, Mary
Lee, it would do to ask grandmother? I shouldn't
in the least mind asking Aunt Helen."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't ask them for the world," replied
Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"But it isn't for ourselves."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>
<p>"I don't care; it's asking just the same isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes, that's so, and I made up my mind never
to ask them for the least thing."</p>

<p>"It's all very well to be friends with them, I suppose,"
said her sister. "I mean to be polite to
them if I ever meet them, but I don't think we
ought to place ourselves under obligations to them
in the smallest way." Mary Lee evidently voiced
her Aunt Sarah's opinions.</p>

<p>"Oh, well," sighed Nan, "then I won't, but I
am going to tell them about Daniella. I was just
thinking, Mary Lee, suppose Daniella won't take
anything after we have had the bazaar for her
benefit. What shall we do then?"</p>

<p>"Give the money for something else: home
missions or traveling libraries or something. We
shall have had the fun anyhow," a view of the matter
which Nan regarded as very sensible. Mary
Lee generally did have sensible advice to give.</p>

<p>"I'll make a lot of panuchee," Nan went on, "and
I'll put black walnuts in some; nearly every one likes
that kind best. I know the Academy boys will buy
it, and that it will go off like hot cakes. Cousin Mag
is going to send a fine cake and Miss Bouldin has
promised one. Do you think it would be best to
have a fancy table or just things to eat?"</p>

<p>Mary Lee considered the question. "It will be a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>little more trouble to have the fancy table, but if we
find people want to give things of that kind we can
have it. We'll ask Cousin Polly."</p>

<p>"And <i>where</i> shall we have it?" said Nan. This
was the most frequently discussed question and they
had not, as yet, come to any satisfactory answer to it.</p>

<p>Mary Lee looked out of the window thoughtfully.
"I am sure I don't know," she replied. "No one
wants to give up a room big enough."</p>

<p>"If mother were only here," sighed Nan, "she'd
think of some place that would do; she always has
ideas." Then suddenly the girl gave a little squeal
and clutched Mary Lee's arm. "I know," she cried.
"Why didn't we think of it before? We'll have
nothing to pay for it and it will not put any one to
inconvenience, and it will be as if we really had it
ourselves as we wanted to do in the first place. We
can use the old wing."</p>

<p>"Of course we can," said Mary Lee. "It will be
just the place. There is plenty of room up-stairs or
down. We can have the eatables in the library and
the fancy things up-stairs in the room over it.
Nan, that's splendid. Let's go straight to tell
Polly."</p>

<p>They dashed out of the house and down the
street to the Lewis's where Polly met them at the
door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>
<p>"We have an idea," said Nan, breathlessly.</p>

<p>"I thought you must have something the way you
came tearing," said Polly. "I'm glad it isn't anything
breakable."</p>

<p>Nan was too anxious to give her suggestion to
notice the playful irony. "We're going to have the
bazaar in the old wing of our house," she said.
"It's empty and handy and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dirty," laughed Polly.</p>

<p>"It can be cleaned easily enough. Now, Cousin
Polly, why will you laugh at it? Isn't it a fine
idea?" Nan was aggrieved.</p>

<p>"It certainly is, Nan," returned her cousin. "I
won't make fun, I really won't. What does Aunt
Sarah say about it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, she won't care. We spoke of using our
living-room first, you know, but she put her foot
down, and when Aunt Sarah does put her foot
down, she puts it down hard. You know there are
four rooms in the wing beside the attic; we can use
the two largest rooms for the tables and keep the
supplies in the others."</p>

<p>Polly nodded. "We really could serve supper,
or have a loan exhibit," she said reflectively, "and we
might then be able to make quite a sum, but I
reckon we'd better not attempt too much. Maybe
some other time we can do that. Yes, Nan, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>wing will be just the place. Now, let me see. You
and Betty Selden can have the eatables and I will
have Mary Lee with me at the fancy table. Jack and
Jean can be flower girls and Ran can take the money
at the door."</p>

<p>"Where can we get flowers at this time of year?"
asked Mary Lee. "We don't want to buy them, do
we?"</p>

<p>"Oh, everybody has a few house plants," returned
Polly, "and there are still chrysanthemums in
bloom out of doors. We can make up some very
small bouquets and sell them for five cents
apiece."</p>

<p>"What I want to know is exactly what we are
going to do with the money," said Nan. "People
ask me and I can't tell them."</p>

<p>"Why, it's for Daniella," said her cousin.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know; but she wouldn't take any when
you offered it to her."</p>

<p>"Then we'll spend it for her in whatever way
seems best. Where are you off to now?"</p>

<p>"We must tell Aunt Sarah what we have decided
to do, and we have lots to do to get ready in time.
I think I'll begin to clean the rooms at once," said
Nan, eager for the fray.</p>

<p>"You'll do nothing of the kind," said Polly. "I'll
come over to-morrow with old Achsah and get them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>in order. I'll have to see about tables. I suppose
some long boards supported on boxes would do."</p>

<p>"There's the joggle-board," said Nan, "we could
use that." The joggle-board was a useful possession;
it had been put up for the children's amusement
in the first place, and was a very long, very
tough, very limber board, the two ends of which
securely rested on uprights. It gave in the middle
to the weight of the body and as younger children,
the Corners delighted to joggle on it; even now Jack
and Jean sometimes entertained themselves by its
springing motion, though it was more often used as
a repository for anything that came handy. The
milk pans sunned there, pies were set upon it to
cool, tomatoes were placed there for ripening,
seeds were spread out for drying.</p>

<p>Polly thought rather favorably of the joggle-board.
"We'll try it," she said, "if it isn't too
long to go in those rooms. I'll ask father where we
can get some other boards. We can cover them
with table-cloths and they will do very well."</p>

<p>"There are no other boards at our house," remarked
Mary Lee. "Unc' Landy uses up every bit
and end to fix up the fences and roofs."</p>

<p>"We'll get some somewhere," said Polly.</p>

<p>The two girls ran home, eager to view the possibilities
of the wing. They flung open the windows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>of the deserted rooms, discussed their size, advantages
and disadvantages.</p>

<p>"It will be as cold as charity," declared Mary
Lee.</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to have fires, open fires will be
cheerful, and we'll make the place as pretty as possible."</p>

<p>"My, how dusty the windows are; it's going to
be a sight of work," said Mary Lee.</p>

<p>However, this matter was taken off their hands
by Polly who pressed her friends into service and by
the last day of the month all was ready. Pine
branches and autumn leaves decorated the mantel;
curtains were hung at the windows; the long tables
up-stairs presented articles pretty, useful and dainty,
while down-stairs was shown such an array of
goodies that every schoolboy dived into his pocket
the moment he entered the door. Packages of
panuchee tied up in Japanese napkins were in great
demand; caramels were scarcely less favored, and
cakes disappeared bodily in no time. Jack and Jean
disposed of every bunch of flowers, and up-stairs,
though the fancy articles went less slowly, they met
a steady sale and very few were left by the end of
the evening. These were sold by auction. Colonel
Lewis undertook the office of auctioneer, serving so
successfully that while every buyer thought he or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>she had a bargain, the articles really brought a fair
price.</p>

<p>When all was over, and the last visitor had departed,
the money was counted, the three boys,
Ran, Phil and Ashby willingly undertaking to do
this. "Twenty-seven dollars and forty-five cents,"
they announced.</p>

<p>"My, haven't we done well!" exclaimed the
girls.</p>

<p>"I thought if we made twenty or twenty-five it
would be a lot," said Nan. "I almost wish I were
a mountain girl myself to have a bazaar held for
me."</p>

<p>Jean looked quite shocked at this remark, but Jack
agreed with Nan that it would not be a bad thing
for one.</p>

<p>Polly was appointed guardian of the fund and it
was agreed that an expedition to the mountain
cabin should be made that they might learn what
Daniella required and to what use it were best to
put the money.</p>

<p>During this time the little maid of the mountain
never dreamed of what was going on in the valley
below, where the town whose spires she could see,
seemed a far, unknown and mysterious place. If
she had imagined that she was the constant thought
of a little group of girls, or if she had known that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>their keen sympathies and tender desires went out
toward her, she would have been less desolate than
she was, sitting in the cabin alone with her feeble
old grandfather whose mind was like that of a little
child.</p>

<p>For two days these two had been there alone,
Daniella watching, waiting by the tiny window,
watching and waiting for the return of her mother
who had gone to town to get a few things that she
felt they could no longer do without.</p>

<p>A long time old Daniel Boggs and his son's wife
had lived on the mountain. Here little Daniella had
been born a month after her father's death. Here
the child had thriven like an early spring flower not
afraid of chill winds and lack of sunshine. Old
Daniel had his little patch of corn, his wood lot, a
few rows of potatoes, and a couple of pigs. If his
revenues were increased by any other means, his
family did not know it. They had enough and
were content till in course of time Daniel became
more of a child than his little granddaughter, and of
late had lapsed into almost a helpless state. He
had to be constantly watched lest he do some mischief,
and he had become unable to do any work so
now though the corn had been gathered and the
potatoes unearthed by Daniella and her mother, the
wood-pile was low and the winter was coming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>which would find them wanting many things. To
get these Daniella's mother had gone to town taking
with her a dozen rabbits which they had trapped,
and which she hoped to sell.</p>

<p>For two days, Daniella had kept up the fire, had
fed her grandfather, had looked after her chickens
and the pigs and now was anxiously wondering
why her mother did not come. Did it take so long
to sell a dozen rabbits? In the small square window
her anxious little face was framed as a party of
young people came up the road. Daniella recognized
them at once. There was the young lady
who had promised her the red jacket and with her
were two younger girls one of whom she had seen
before. Daniella stood watching them. They
came straight to the cabin and knocked on the
door. Daniella opened to them.</p>

<p>"May we come in?" said Polly. "I have
brought your red jacket."</p>

<p>Daniella's dark eyes sparkled, and she stepped
aside that her visitors might enter. "Maw done
gone to town," she said. "Tain't nobody hyah
'scusin' me an' grandad sence day 'fo' yessaday
mawnin'." She had been so long with only the
doddering old man in the corner that she was ready
to talk.</p>

<p>"When do you expect your mother?" asked Polly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>
<p>"I dunno. She say when she done sell her
rabbits she come back. Hit take a pow'ful time
to sell rabbits, don't it?"</p>

<p>"It ought not to," answered Polly a little uneasily.
She was wondering if the woman had deserted her
daughter or if any ill could have befallen her.
"Aren't you afraid to stay here alone?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No'm. Grandad jest lak a baby an' I kin cook
the wittles, but I wisht maw'd git back."</p>

<p>The old man in the chimney corner stirred and
looked vacantly toward the visitors. "Fine day,"
he said, wagging his head, then he added in a confidential
whisper, "but they won't find it."</p>

<p>"Now, grandad," chided Daniella, "jest you quit
talkin'."</p>

<p>The old man turned again to the fire and mumbled
something about no one's ever finding out anything
from him. Meanwhile the girls looked around the
room. It was fairly clean, though dingy. A four
post bedstead over which was a patchwork quilt,
stood in one corner; in another was a sort of bunk
over which was thrown a hairy robe of skins sewed
together; two hickory chairs, a rude stool, a bench,
a table made up the rest of the furniture. On a
shelf was a pile of dishes and against the wall hung
a few cooking utensils. It was by far the simplest
establishment the girls had ever been in.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>
<p>Polly produced the red jacket, known in common
parlance by the unpleasant name of "sweater," and
Daniella gave an exclamation of pleasure. "Try it
on," said Polly, holding it out, and Daniella thrust
her arms into the sleeves. She gave no thanks, but
her evident delight was sufficient.</p>

<p>"Ef I had a pair of shoes I'd go hunt up maw,"
she said. "Leastways, I'd go if I could leave the
old man."</p>

<p>"The shoes are here, too," said Polly, as she drew
from her bag both shoes and stockings.</p>

<p>Daniella straightway plumped down on the floor
to try them on. "Shoes never feels good," she
said, "but these is the nicest feelin' I ever had. Oh,
I wisht maw would come. Do you reckon she
could take all this time to sell rabbits? She had
twelve of 'em. We trapped 'em, her an' me. She
was goin' to take 'em to the sto' and git things fo'
'em, an' then she was comin' back."</p>

<p>"She ought to be here then," said Polly.</p>

<p>"I wisht I could go hunt her up," said Daniella,
anxiously. "You don't reckon nothin' could have
ketched her, do you?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't see why anything should," Polly
tried to reassure her. She gave a glance at the
others, a glance which Daniella read with alarm.</p>

<p>"Yuh-alls thinks somethin's went wrong with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>my maw," she cried. Daniella looked helplessly at
the old man. "I dassent leave him, I dassent, an' I
wants to fin' my maw."</p>

<p>Without a word to the others, Nan stepped forward.
"I'll stay with your grandfather," she said.
"You go to town with my cousin and my sister and
hunt up your mother. I'll stay till you can come
back."</p>

<p>"Oh, Nan!" Mary Lee gave a low ejaculation.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nan!" repeated Polly, "ought you?"</p>

<p>Nan nodded. "Yes, I think I ought."</p>

<p>"I won't forget you," said Daniella in a low tense
voice. "You're good, you are, an' I'll work fo' you.
I'll trap rabbits fo' you, I'll get nuts fo' you, I will.
Grandad ain't no trouble, but you has to watch him
lessen he sets hisse'f on fiah, an' he has to hev his
supper airly. I'll come right back soon as I finds
maw," she promised eagerly.</p>

<p>"I will stay till you come," said Nan, steadily.</p>

<p>"Thar's a pone o' braid on the shelf, un'er thet
dish," said Daniella, "an' thar's rashers hangin' up
thar, an' thar's long sweetenin' in thet jug. Thar
am' no other kin'."</p>

<p>Nan was mystified but she said nothing.</p>

<p>"All grandad has to hev is a bowl of coffee an'
some braid," Daniella went on. "I'm goin' away
fur a little while, grandad," she said, turning to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>old man. "Now you behave yo'se'f an' don't give
no trouble."</p>

<p>"Nobody'll git anythin' outen me," said the old
man with a chuckle. "I'll be as dumb as an oyster."</p>

<p>"He don't know what I'm talkin' about," Daniella
explained. "You needn't min' him, jest keep up
the fiah an' see that he doesn't fool with hit."</p>

<p>"If we're going, we must start at once," said
Polly, "so you can get back to-night, Nan," to
which remark Nan heartily agreed.</p>

<p>The glory of the red jacket and new shoes did not
fill Daniella's thoughts, for now that her fears were
aroused, she was more and more anxious about her
mother, and she climbed up into the carriage with
no just appreciation of the situation.</p>

<p>At the last moment, Polly came back. "It seems
perfectly dreadful to leave you here with that silly
old man, Nan," she said. "I shall not have an easy
moment till I know you are safe at home."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't bother about me," Nan replied. "I
shall do very well, but I do hope Daniella will get
back before night."</p>

<p>So they drove off and the last thing that Nan saw
of them was the gleam of the red jacket as the carriage
disappeared behind the trees down the longer
and less steep road by which it had come. She
wondered what she would do with herself during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>the hours which must intervene before she could be
released. But here her habit of dreaming came in
well, and she was presently building air-castles
while the old man dozed, or muttered to himself in
the corner.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV</a><br />

<small>SACRIFICES</small></h2>


<p>It was many an hour before Nan was relieved of
her self-imposed task of keeping house for old Daniel
Boggs, and in the meantime Daniella was going
through such experiences as her wildest dreams had
never suggested to her.</p>

<p>Polly drove directly home to consult her parents
about the best way to set to work to look for Mrs.
Boggs, but she found neither her father nor mother
at the house, though her brother Tom happened to
be in, and volunteered to go down-town to make
inquiries.</p>

<p>"If anything has happened to her in town, they
will know at the police station or the hospital,"
he said. "I'll go to the station first, for it is right
on my way. If I hear anything there, I'll follow it
up."</p>

<p>Polly led Daniella, conscious of new shoes and
jacket, into the house where she sat stiffly on the
edge of a chair, refusing to move or to speak, lost
in wonderment. Never before had she been in such a
room as that into which Polly took her, although it
was but the plainly furnished sitting-room of an ordinary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>house. Never before had Daniella seen pictures
in gilt frames, books in colored bindings, carpeted
floors or curtained windows. She sat as if in
a dream, staring around in amazement. She was
too proud to ask questions, too shy to leave her
chair, too embarrassed to speak.</p>

<p>Within half an hour, Tom Lewis returned. He
called to Polly, but Daniella heard him, and with a
swift direct movement darted toward the entry
where he was. She stood rigidly erect waiting for
his first words. "Come out here, Polly," he said.
"I want to speak to you." And he led his sister to
the porch. "I couldn't tell you while that child's
great eyes were upon me," he said. "I have found
her mother. She is at the hospital badly hurt.
She has been unconscious, or at least delirious, and
they could not discover her name till this morning.
Now, what's to be done?"</p>

<p>"Nan mustn't stay up there, and the old man is
to be considered," said Polly thoughtfully. "Perhaps,
Tom, I'd better go over and speak to Aunt
Sarah. Mary Lee and Phil went over and have given
her some idea of the state of things. Meanwhile,
you hunt up father and see if he can advise anything
to be done about that old man. We can't, for humanity's
sake, allow Daniella to stay there in that
lonely cabin while her mother is getting well."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>
<p>"And we must get Nan home," said Tom. "I'll
find father, Polly, and he'll know what's best. The
woman is not likely to be out for some weeks, they
told me."</p>

<p>"Dear, dear," exclaimed Polly.</p>

<p>"What woman? Where is she?" cried an excited
voice at her side. Polly turned to put her arm
around Daniella who was looking at her with big
frightened eyes. "Your mother has been hurt,
Daniella, dear. She was run over by a wagon on
the street, but she is in good hands and&mdash;&mdash;-"</p>

<p>"Where is she? Where?" interrupted Daniella,
wrenching herself away. "I wants to see her.
Take me to her."</p>

<p>"I cannot this minute, but you shall see her as
soon as we can make arrangements. Be a good
girl, Daniella, and don't make a fuss. We are going
to do all we can for both you and your mother."</p>

<p>Daniella choked back a great sob, but sat down
on a chair in the hall, her eyes like those of some
patient, suffering animal.</p>

<p>Polly took a seat beside her. "We are not going
to let you stay up on the mountain alone, so far
from your mother," she went on gently. "My
brother has gone to find out what can be done about
your grandfather. Now, will you stay here, or will
you come with me to Nan's home? Nan, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>know, is the one who is staying with your grandfather."</p>

<p>Daniella nodded. "I know her name; I ain't goin'
to fergit it neither. I'll go thar with you."</p>

<p>Polly took her to where Aunt Sarah was listening
to Mary Lee's account of the afternoon's adventure.
"What's this?" said Miss Dent, as Polly
entered. "Why did you let Nan stay up there,
Polly?"</p>

<p>"She wanted to stay," said Polly with a warning
look. "This is Daniella Boggs, Aunt Sarah. We
have just heard that her mother has met with an
accident and is in the hospital. The nurses assured
Tom that she was doing well, but we must make
arrangements for Daniella." She followed Aunt
Sarah into the next room where they talked in low
tones together while Mary Lee, Phil and the twins
put their heads together to make a plan of their
own.</p>

<p>Daniella sat on the edge of the sofa, her hands
clenched and her tears rolling down upon the red
jacket. She could no longer keep them back.
Presently the children left her there and she could
hear them all talking in the adjoining room.</p>

<p>"Please, Aunt Sarah," begged Jack.</p>

<p>"Oh, do, auntie," pleaded Jean.</p>

<p>"I'll go without butter," put in Mary Lee.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span></p>
<p>"And I'll empty my savings bank," added Phil.</p>

<p>"Go 'long, go 'long, all of you," said Aunt Sarah.
"Wait till your elders have talked this thing over
and then we will see."</p>

<p>"One more couldn't make so very, very much
difference," Mary Lee began again.</p>

<p>"And we could sleep three in a bed," Jean's voice
came in.</p>

<p>"Or we could do something. There's a lot of
room if we only had the furniture," Jack's argument
followed.</p>

<p>"I'll bet mother has a bedstead to spare," Phil
chimed in eagerly, "and we could rig up one of
those dressing-table things out of boxes."</p>

<p>"Hush, hush," Aunt Sarah commanded. "You
drive me wild. Not another word, Phil Lewis, till
I see your father."</p>

<p>Then all of them trooped back into the room
where Daniella was sitting. "Now, Daniella," said
Polly, "you are to stay here with these little girls
till we get everything arranged, and when I come
back, I will take you to see your mother, if I can."
And she went off with Miss Sarah, leaving Daniella
feeling desolate and scared.</p>

<p>The children, however, could not avoid the subject
which was so near to their hearts. All their
young sympathies were aroused. They would have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>given Daniella any of their possessions, and were
ready to make any sacrifices. "Did they not know
what it meant to have a mother ill and away from
them?"</p>

<p>"Our mother is ill, too," said Mary Lee, "and
she is way off, too far for us ever to go and see her.
She had to go there so as to get well."</p>

<p>Daniella felt the sympathy which this state of
affairs must bring about, and she wiped her eyes
upon the back of her hand, and tried to force back
her tears.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't you like to stay with us till your
mother gets well?" ventured Jack, eyeing the disconsolate
Daniella.</p>

<p>Daniella blinked away her tears but made no
reply.</p>

<p>"Hush, Jack," said Mary Lee in a half whisper.
"You mustn't say that yet."</p>

<p>"I just wanted to know," said Jack, still gazing
at Daniella.</p>

<p>"It isn't polite for you to stare so," whispered
Mary Lee, and Jack turned away her eyes.</p>

<p>"What do you suppose they will do now with
the money we made at the bazaar?" whispered Jean
to Phil. But he shook his head reprovingly at her.</p>

<p>They found that they could not draw Daniella
into conversation, but they did not think it polite to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>leave her. Jack brought her a picture-book to look
at. She stared at the pictures uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p>Mary Lee produced a piece of needlework she
was doing; it had no better effect.</p>

<p>Jean ran out and brought back Rubaiyat, whom
she placed in Daniella's lap. Then the forlorn little
stranger smiled and smoothed the soft fur.</p>

<p>Encouraged by this, and not to be outdone by her
twin, Jack rushed to the kitchen and came back
with a cake and an apple which she offered to the
interesting visitor.</p>

<p>Daniella eyed the apple for a moment and then
shook her head. She was not going to seem to
need food in the presence of these more favored
children. But she seemed to take comfort in cuddling
Ruby and they felt that they had done all that
they could.</p>

<p>In the course of an hour Colonel Lewis came in
with his daughter and Miss Sarah. "Tom and I
have arranged it," he told Phil in answer to the
eager questions he put as he ran out to meet them.
"We've found a place to take the grandfather. He
must go to the County Asylum, as his mind is impaired.
We must get Nan home right away, so
Tom or I will drive up for her and bring the old
man back. They'll keep him at the hospital to-night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>and to-morrow he can go to the place I spoke
of. He will be well cared for."</p>

<p>"And what about Daniella?" asked Phil.</p>

<p>"That's not settled yet. She will stay here till
we can determine what is best to be done. The
main thing now is to get Nan home. I feel very
loth to leave her there alone a moment longer than
necessary. Mrs. Boggs is in good hands and is improving."</p>

<p>As Polly entered the room, she said, "Now,
Daniella, you may go to see your mother." Down
went Ruby, awakened rudely from the nap she was
taking in Daniella's lap, and the little girl, without
waiting for further invitation, darted out the door.
She ran down to the gate so fast that Polly could not
overtake her. "Wait, Daniella, wait," she called.
"You don't know which way to go." Then
Daniella paused and those watching saw them go
swiftly down the street.</p>

<p>During the time that all this was going on, Nan
was patiently keeping watch in the cabin. The
short winter day was drawing to a close when she
stirred the fire and tried to set a kettle of water to
boil. Little as she was used to cooking, she was
less used to an open fire, and found some difficulty
in making the coffee. But she accomplished it at
last, emptied some into a bowl and poured into it a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>liberal supply of "long sweetening" which she discovered
to be molasses, then putting some of the
corn bread upon a plate, she set it before the old
man. He was able to feed himself which he did
noisily, but with evident enjoyment. Nan could
touch none of the food herself, though she was
hungry after a picnic lunch taken on the drive up
the mountain. The hours began to drag wearily.
Once in a while, the old man would make some
meaningless remark, supposing Nan to be his
granddaughter. Two or three times he attempted
to meddle with the fire, but Nan was able to stop
him. He was simple and harmless, but, like a child,
in danger of doing himself an injury by some sudden
piece of mischief.</p>

<p>Nan wondered how Daniella could stand living in
the little cooped up, bare cabin, how she could endure
the privations and the lack of companionship.
As the shadows deepened, she began to fear it
might be possible that she would have to stay
there all night, and was relieved to hear the sound
of wheels, and then her Cousin Tom Lewis's
voice.</p>

<p>"Heigho, Nan!" he cried, "Ran and I have come
for you."</p>

<p>"Is Daniella with you?" asked Nan, peering out
the door.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<p>"No," answered Tom as he came up to the cabin.</p>

<p>"Oh, then I can't leave. I'll have to stay with
the old man," returned Nan with a great feeling of
disappointment. "I promised, you know."</p>

<p>Tom came forward. "No, you won't stay," he
said. "We are going to take the old man, too.
Where is he?"</p>

<p>"In there by the fire. Oh, Cousin Tom, who says
he is to go, and where are you going to take him?
What's become of Daniella, and has anything happened
to her mother?"</p>

<p>"One question at a time, please. It is all right
about the old gentleman, so don't you bother. The
first thing to do is to get him ready, and then there'll
be time to answer your questions on the way home.
I've brought an old army overcoat to wrap him up
in, for I didn't suppose we should find much here,
from what Polly said."</p>

<p>The bewildered old man was soon bundled into
the carriage. He whimpered like a child at being
taken from the cabin, and kept saying over and over,
"I'm innercent, I'm innercent. I never took no
hand in the business."</p>

<p>"He probably imagines we are sheriffs after him
for a moonshiner," said Tom. "Poor old chap!"
He tried to reassure the old man but found it was no
use, and after a while he lapsed into silence, seeming
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>to find comfort alone in the supposed fact that his
granddaughter was with him.</p>

<p>On the way down the mountain, Nan learned of
all that had happened since morning, and kept up
such a running fire of questions and comments as
made Tom declare she must have been all day
thinking them up.</p>

<p>She felt that she had been away for weeks when
at last they stopped before her own door. Was it
only that morning that they had started out to take
the red jacket to Daniella?</p>

<p>Mary Lee and the twins rushed out to meet her,
full of the day's happenings. "Daniella's here,"
cried Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, and she's been to see her mother at the
hospital," said Jack.</p>

<p>"And her mother is crite ill," put in Jean.
"Cousin Polly says she can't take any food except
licrids because she has such a fever. She was hurt
awfully, but she told Cousin Polly they couldn't
have done more for her if she had been a creen."</p>

<p>"We want to keep Daniella here," Mary Lee
went on, "and Aunt Sarah is thinking about it."</p>

<p>"Where is Daniella now?" asked Nan.</p>

<p>"She's at the hospital. Cousin Tom is going to
bring her back when he takes her grandfather there.
Isn't it a good thing that Cousin Philip is one of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>directors? He had everything hurried up and
settled so much sooner. Was it very awful staying
up there all day, Nan? Were you scared?"</p>

<p>"It was lonesome, but I wasn't frightened.
There wasn't anything to do but give the old man
his supper and keep him from fooling with the fire.
I couldn't eat their messes myself."</p>

<p>"Then you must be half starved," said Mary Lee.
"You poor child. We waited supper for you all.
Mitty is putting it on the table now."</p>

<p>Nan thought that never before in her life had
batter bread and cold ham tasted so good. Never
had biscuits and baked apples such a flavor.</p>

<p>After supper, Miss Sarah called the four girls to
her. "Now, children," she said, "the little girl
will be here presently, and before she gets here we
must understand whether she is to stay or not.
They will take her in at the Children's Home or the
St. Mary's Orphan Asylum, while her mother is ill,
so we need not feel that she will not be looked
after."</p>

<p>"Oh, but it would be dreadful to shut up that
little wild thing in a strict place like the Home or
the Asylum," said Nan, with keen appreciation of
what Daniella would suffer.</p>

<p>"But you know, my dear, that every penny
counts with us, and that all that can be spared must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>go for your mother's expenses. If we keep the
child here, even for a couple of months, she will
have to have clothing, her board will cost something,
and it will mean sacrifices on the part of all
of us. Now, the question is: What are you willing
to give up?"</p>

<p>"I think I can get along without anything more
in the way of clothes this winter," said Nan, visions
of a new frock fading away.</p>

<p>"And I am sure I can if Nan can," said Mary
Lee, readily.</p>

<p>"I'll wear hand-me-downs and not say a word,"
said Jack, "and I'll give Daniella all my rice pudding."</p>

<p>"Because you don't like it," Jean spoke with
scorn.</p>

<p>"Well, never mind, if she likes it, what's the difference?"
said Jack, argumentatively. "If I gave
up something she didn't like and that I did, it
wouldn't do her any good. You haven't said yet
that you'd give up anything."</p>

<p>"Of course I'll give up something," declared
Jean, offended. "I'll give up whatever Aunt
Sarah says I ought."</p>

<p>"Good little girl," said Aunt Sarah, approvingly.
"I hope you will not have to give up much. You
younger ones can always take the clothes of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>older ones, and as for food we shall not be able to
set a very much plainer table on account of our
boarders. I think there will be rice pudding enough
for every one, but we'll have gingerbread instead of
rich cake, and eat more oatmeal instead of so many
hot griddle-cakes."</p>

<p>"I suppose they do take a crauntity of butter,"
sighed Jean, who liked griddle-cakes above all things.</p>

<p>"We'll eat 'long sweetening' on them," said
Nan, with a smile at the recollection of the Boggs's
molasses jug. "By the way, I never thought of
Daniella's chickens and her little pig. They killed
the big pig, and there is quite a lot of meat up
there. Some one will have to go up there after
those things."</p>

<p>"They can be sold," said Aunt Sarah, "and that
will help out their expenses."</p>

<p>"Oh, can't we keep the chickens and the little
pig? Then Daniella won't cost us anything for
eggs."</p>

<p>"But the chickens will cost us something for
food," argued Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I forgot that they must be fed. I always
think of chickens just picking and scratching
around for a living," said Nan. "Well, Aunt
Sarah, is it settled? Do we keep Daniella here or
don't we?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>
<p>"If you all are willing to make the sacrifices, we
will keep her, but you must not murmur. I want
you to realize what it means. Now, in the flush of
your generous spirit, it seems easy, but after a while,
when your coat looks shabby, Nan, and your best
frock is too short, and when Mary Lee must wear
her old hat and Jack must be satisfied with made-over
clothing, and rice-pudding oftener, when Jean
can't have griddle-cakes swimming in butter, and
must have her shoes mended and remended, it may
not seem so easy. My own inclination is always
to fling wide a hospitable door, but we must think
of what is due to your mother before anything else."</p>

<p>The four children were silent. They realized the
truth of all this. At last Jack spoke up. "I don't
care; I'd just as soon have the made-overs; you
don't have to be near so careful of them."</p>

<p>"There is some comfort in that," agreed Nan.
"Yes, Aunt Sarah, we'll do it, won't we, Mary
Lee?"</p>

<p>"I will, if you will."</p>

<p>"Then it's settled," Nan declared. "Daniella is
to be ours till further notice. Will she go to
school, Aunt Sarah? She doesn't know even how
to read."</p>

<p>"We can see about that later," Aunt Sarah told
her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>
<p>Later, this question did come up, for when the
chickens and pig were domiciled at the Corners' and
Daniella had become used to her surroundings, she
realized that if she would be like the rest she must
know much more than she did. At first she was
like some little wild animal, and could not be kept
in the house, saying she could not breathe there.
She was shy of every one but Nan and Mary Lee,
and fled at the approach of strangers. She did not
know how to wear the clothing provided for her,
nor had she ever been inside a church. Shops were
a marvel and a school was something that had to be
elaborately explained, but in time she came to understand
that she was unlike the rest of the world
and that if she would be in it she must be of it.
Then she told Nan she wanted to know what was
inside books, and she would go to school. One
day of the routine was enough for her. She escaped
before the morning was half over to Nan's
mortification.</p>

<p>"You ought at least to have stayed till noon," she
said, chidingly.</p>

<p>"I couldn't, I couldn't," replied Daniella vehemently.
"I felt like a wild creetur in a trap, and
them gals starin' and snickerin' made me feel like a
fool thing. I ain't goin' to set alongside o' babies,
an' I ain't no right with gals my own size. I don't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>want to hev nothin' to do with none of 'em, 'scusin'
you an' Mary Lee. If I never l'arns nothin', I ain't
goin' to be cooped up lak a po' trapped rabbit or a
bird in a cage. I don't keer if I don't know nothin'.
Maw'll love me jest the same."</p>

<p>Nan was quite distressed. She had felt a real
missionary spirit in rescuing Daniella from the depths
of her ignorance. She dreamed of the day when
she should be proud of her, when pretty little
Daniella would appear as well as any girl, but now
her hopes were blasted. She thought long upon the
subject. She discussed it with her sisters, with her
Aunt Sarah, with Cousin Polly and Cousin Mag but
no one could seem to offer a solution to the problem.
It was cruel, every one thought, to send a girl to
school who felt so keenly about it. Why make her
miserable for the short time she was living in a
civilized community? After a while she would
have to return to her wild life, then where would be
the good of having made her unhappy?</p>

<p>But Nan felt differently about it. She had a
scheme of teaching Daniella herself, but the mountain
girl spurned it, and said she wasn't goin' to hav
no gal her own size l'arnin' her, though if the truth
were known, she really did not want to give Nan
the task. So at last Nan took her difficulty to her
Aunt Helen, and here she found a friend in need,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span>for Miss Helen declared that nothing would interest
her more than to teach Daniella for an hour or two
a day.</p>

<p>"She is like a blank, unwritten page," she said.
"And I'd like the experience of putting my mark
upon her. I should like to try some of my own
theories. You say she is bright, Nan?"</p>

<p>"Real bright. Not like schooly brightness, but
in a queer way, that shows she thinks a lot more
than you suppose."</p>

<p>"So much the better. I can try to bring out what
is in her, by my own methods."</p>

<p>Then Nan, by coaxing and arguing induced
Daniella to try the experiment of going to Uplands
for an hour each day, and after her very first trial it
seemed that Miss Helen had solved the problem,
and that Daniella's education had fairly begun.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI</a><br />

<small>PARTY FROCKS</small></h2>


<p>Thanksgiving Day went by quietly; there was little
made of it here in Virginia, and the girls would
scarcely have remembered it if their mother had not
written asking each one to tell her what she was
most thankful for. The answers were very characteristic.</p>

<p>Jean wrote: "I am thankful that the wildcat
didn't get Phil and Mary Lee, and that Daniella is
here. I am thankful that her mother and my
mother are both getting better."</p>

<p>Jack wrote: "I am thankful that I don't like rice
pudding and that I do like molasses on my batter
cakes. I am thankful that old clothes don't last as
long as new ones, and that people don't make such
a fuss when you get spots on them or tear them.
I am thankful I don't get into quite so many scrapes
in winter as I do in summer."</p>

<p>Mary Lee's thankfulness was expressed in these
words: "I am thankful that little wild creatures
have warm holes and nests to creep into. I am
thankful that birds can fly south where it is warm.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>I am thankful we have enough to eat and to keep
us comfortable, and I am thankful we do not have
to live in a little cabin on the mountain, and dear
mother, I am very thankful you are getting better."</p>

<p>Said Nan: "I am thankful, you dearest of
mothers, for so many things I don't know how to
choose, but first and foremost I am thankful for
you. I might as well say, too, that I am thankful
for all my kinsfolk, for I am even thankful now for
Aunt Sarah, since I had to cook that supper for the
boys and since she nursed me so patiently when I
broke my arm. I certainly am thankful for Aunt
Helen. She is such a dear. You know she is
teaching Daniella, and, yes, I am thankful for
grandmother, if she is cranky. I am thankful for
the whole world, for music, for books, for pictures,
for trees and flowers and sky, and even the snow
on the ground. It looks so perfectly pure and clean
and makes me think of white souls. I am thankful
for all these things, but oh, mother, I shall be thankfuller,
thankfullest when you get home."</p>

<p>Though the letters eased the mother's loneliness,
they brought a rain of tears to her eyes, and filled
her with longing to see her four girls. "They are
so like them," she murmured. "Each one has
written herself so plainly."</p>

<p>Daniella's becoming a part of the household made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>less of a change than the girls had expected, for
Aunt Sarah managed well, and spread out her
economies so that they covered all meals very
slightly, and the extras were little missed. When
one has rice pudding once a week instead of once in
ten days, or when griddle-cakes are served only on
Saturdays instead of Wednesdays and Saturdays, it
really makes little difference.</p>

<p>However a time did come when the sacrifice
loomed up more largely and for a time there were
four rather unhappy little girls. It was just after a
neat maid left at the door four small white envelopes
which, when opened, were discovered to be invitations
to a party given by Betty Wise, a little girl
who was not an intimate acquaintance, but whom
each of the four Corners admired greatly. Betty
lived in such a beautiful old house, two hundred
years old, and was considered to belong to one of
the best families in the county. The grounds around
the house were always in beautiful order; Betty herself
was the most daintily clad of little maidens,
and in church the four girls who sat in a row in the
pew behind her gave many a thought to Betty
Wise's pretty hats, handsome coats, and the
delicate ribbons she always wore on her hair. To
be invited to Judge Wise's house was an honor not
to be underrated and the four Corners clutched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>their envelopes and looked at each other with shining
eyes.</p>

<p>"Isn't it splendid?" said Nan. "A real sure
enough party. I expect it will be perfectly beautiful.
It was so perfectly lovely of Betty to invite all
four of us."</p>

<p>"It certainly was lovely," sighed Mary Lee,
"but, Nan, what are we going to wear?"</p>

<p>Nan's face fell. What indeed? She hastily made
an inventory of her last summer's white frocks.
Not one that would do. "We can manage something
for Jack and Jean, I am sure," she said,
"though there isn't one of us has a decent sash, and
as for slippers, Jean is the only one who has a pair
that will do."</p>

<p>Deep gloom fell upon the little group. The
silence was broken by Mary Lee. "We can't ask
Aunt Sarah, for we promised that we would not
have a single thing new this winter if she would let
us have Daniella. I almost wish we had never gone
up that old mountain."</p>

<p>"Oh, don't say that, Mary Lee," said Nan.
"Just think what would have become of Daniella if
we hadn't gone. She might have perished by this
time."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course, I don't exactly mean that, but I
wish, I almost wish, we had not insisted upon keeping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>her here." It was so nearly the actual wish at
that moment of the other three that no one said a
word.</p>

<p>After a pause, Nan drew a long sigh. "Well,"
she said, "you and I can't possibly go, but perhaps
we can fix up the twins. Jean is all right and there
is a frock of yours that would do on a pinch for
Jack if we can manage slippers. We can look over
the stock. She may have grown up to some of our
castaways, and even if we should find a pair a little
too large, we can stuff cotton in the toes. As for
sashes we'll have to look over everything and see
what we come across."</p>

<p>"I don't want to go if you don't, so there," said
Jack.</p>

<p>"Neither do I," chimed in Jean.</p>

<p>"Oh, but some of us must go. We couldn't be
so rude as to decline for all four of us," said Nan.
"Besides, I shall want to hear all about it even if I
can't go. It is ten days off so I am not going to decline
till I have to."</p>

<p>"I suppose there is no use in saying anything to
Aunt Sarah about it," said Mary Lee with a glimmer
of hope.</p>

<p>Nan shook her head. "No, we must not act as
if we were trying to slide out of our promise.
I was just thinking that perhaps Cousin Polly could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>lend us one or two sashes, and perhaps a pair of
slippers; she has such little feet, but she couldn't
provide for all of us. She is generous enough but
she hasn't enough to go around."</p>

<p>"She could let us have two pairs of slippers if she
were a craudruped," said Jean.</p>

<p>"You'd better tell her that," said Nan, laughing.</p>

<p>"Invitations came for Ran and Ashby, too," Mary
Lee remarked, "and I suppose Phil has one."
Deeper gloom fell upon the group especially when
Nan said solemnly: "And the boys will have to
know why we can't go."</p>

<p>For the next two or three days, the girls avoided
the subject of the party when those of their schoolmates
who had received invitations spoke of it.
Neither was it mentioned in the presence of the
boys. Once in a while one or the other of the four
sisters made to the rest some tragic statement such
as: "Flossy Garrett is going to wear white China
silk." "Lizzie Carter has a new Roman sash," or
"Nell Page's sister is going to lend her a lovely
locket and chain." Deep sighs and mournful countenances
always attended these statements.</p>

<p>With a feeling of proud reserve, Nan never referred
to the party when talking to her Aunt Helen.
Not for worlds would she so much as hint that she
might go if properly costumed; not when that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>store of pretty things still lay untouched and unbestowed.</p>

<p>Jack, however, had no such scruples, and with a
distinct purpose and a defiant front, she went one
afternoon to Uplands. Seating herself directly in
front of her grandmother she observed her solemnly
and thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"You seem to be in a brown study this afternoon,
Jack," said Mrs. Corner. "What are you
thinking about?"</p>

<p>Jack gave a long sigh. "I was thinking how nice
it would be if there were really fairies or if there
were really enchanted lamps and things like Nan
loves to talk about. Anyhow, I wish we could
sometimes change places with people."</p>

<p>"And with whom would you change places?"
asked her grandmother, ready to encourage her to
talk.</p>

<p>"With you," returned Jack.</p>

<p>"With me?" Mrs. Corner looked perfectly astounded,
then she sighed. "You'd soon want to
change back again, little Jack."</p>

<p>"Oh, I know that. I shouldn't care to be a
grandmother for more than an hour."</p>

<p>"But why wish to be a grandmother at all?"
Mrs. Corner's curiosity was aroused. She wondered
what the little girl's fancy could be. "Do listen to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>the child, Helen," she said. "She would like to be
her own grandmother."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd like to be Nan's and Mary Lee's and
Jean's, too," Jack told her.</p>

<p>"But why?"</p>

<p>"If I were a grandmother and had four nice little
girl grandchildren," Jack went on, "I'd do something
or other so they could go to the party at Judge
Wise's."</p>

<p>"And why can't they go? What's to prevent?"
Mrs. Corner asked.</p>

<p>"No frocks, no sashes, no slippers, no money to
buy them with," said Jack, and having delivered
herself of this laconic confession, she faced her
grandmother with a set expression of countenance.
The worst was said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner's delicate fingers trembled in the
wool she was crocheting.</p>

<p>"Who is giving the party?" said Miss Helen
gently. "Tell me all about it, Jack."</p>

<p>"It's to be at Judge Wise's. Betty is going to
have it and it certainly will be fine. Maybe Jean
and I can go if Cousin Polly's slippers will fit and
she will lend us two sashes, but Nan says she and
Mary Lee are just obliged and compelled to stay at
home because they wouldn't be seen in dowdy old
frocks and old high shoes."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>
<p>A little pink flush burned on Mrs. Corner's cheeks.
"Mary Lee has never been near her grandmother,"
she said. "You could hardly expect me to forget
that."</p>

<p>"I wasn't saying anything about your doing
things," said Jack ingenuously. "I was only saying
what I would do if I were a grandmother and
had lovely things put away, and had granddaughters
just crazy to go to a party. I shouldn't mind when
three of them had been polite if one wouldn't be,
and I don't see why they all would have to be done
mean on account of one."</p>

<p>Jack sat thoughtfully considering the matter. "I
reckon," she said, "Mary Lee is something like you.
She wouldn't come here unless you specially asked
her, and you wouldn't go to see her unless she
specially asked you. If mother were at home she
would do something, 'cause mother can do anything;
she is as near a fairy that way as any one
can be, but you know mother isn't here, and we
can't do things ourselves and Aunt Sarah won't.
You know," she added, "it's all on account of
Daniella. We promised Aunt Sarah if she let us
keep Daniella at our house, we wouldn't ask for
anything new this winter, and we would wear our
old clothes. So, of course, when we promised, we
can't change our minds."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why did your aunt exact such a promise from
you?" asked Mrs. Corner, a little haughtily.</p>

<p>"Oh, because she couldn't afford to have her unless
we did. Mother needs all the boys' board
money, and Aunt Sarah does as well as she can,
Nan says. We have rice pudding only once a week
and that really isn't very often."</p>

<p>"Miss Dent is a wonderfully self-sacrificing
woman," said Miss Helen in a low voice. "It is
entirely due to her willingness to take charge of six
children that Mary is able to stay at Saranac."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner's fingers shook even more as she
fingered the wool. Presently she burst out passionately:
"I suppose I am an obdurate old woman to
let one little child's indifference prevent me from
giving happiness to my other grandchildren, but I am
made so, Helen; I can't help it. I have yielded in
many directions. I have accepted the other three
when I said I never would, and I shall meet their
mother half way if she ever allows me." She burst
into a fit of nervous sobbing, and Jack, scared and
awed, slipped away, feeling that she had made
matters even worse.</p>

<p>She made no mention to her sisters of her visit to
Uplands that day, but it had its effect, as was shown
the next morning when a man left at the house
a small trunk addressed to Nan. When the girls
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>came home from school, it stood in the big room
they occupied. They gathered around it in astonishment.
"Where did it come from? Who
brought it? What's in it? Who sent it?" The
questions came thick and fast. A key hung by a
string to the handle. Nan jerked it off fumbling at
the lock in her eagerness. "Do hurry, Nan," cried
Jack, impatiently.</p>

<p>"I am hurrying," returned Nan, "and that is just
what's the matter." The lock at last yielded and
Nan raised the lid amid breathless silence. Over the
tray lay a white cloth; upon this a note was pinned.
Nan opened it and read it aloud. It was from her
Aunt Helen.</p>

<p>"Dear Nan," it read, "mother sends you the
gifts which she regrets having withheld from you
so long. She really meant to send them at Christmas,
but you will not mind if they come earlier.
She wishes you to use your own judgment in disposing
of them and makes but one proviso, and
that is that you will <i>all</i> come over to Uplands and
show yourselves in your party costumes."</p>

<p>The <i>all</i> was underscored. Nan looked at Mary
Lee. "I'll go," said Mary Lee shortly.</p>

<p>It was a small concession to make, she considered,
when the contents of the trunk were displayed and all
the dainty fabrics were examined. Such an oh-ing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>and ah-ing as came from the four delighted girls
brought Aunt Sarah from her room, and to her the
whole story was told. She made but few remarks
but it was evident that she was pleased, and she took
almost as great an interest in the pretty things as the
girls themselves. At the very bottom of the trunk
were two boxes, one marked Nan, the other Jack.
One slip of paper read: "To my granddaughter
Nancy Weston in recognition of her sweet spirit of
forgiveness." The other read: "To brave little
Jack who reminded her grandmother of her duty."</p>

<p>"What have you been doing, Jack?" asked Nan,
before she removed the lid of her box.</p>

<p>"Nothing," replied Jack in an injured tone, "except
to tell her what I would do if I were a grandmother
to four nice little girls."</p>

<p>"Oh, Jack, Jack," laughed Nan, shaking her head
while her fingers eagerly removed the soft cotton
which lay on the top of the box. Then she breathed
a delighted "Oh!" as she held up to view a long
delicate chain of exquisite pink corals. A squeal
from Jack revealed the fact that she had reached
her gift which proved to be a slender gold chain
with a pendant heart of gold set with turquoises.</p>


<div class="figcenter"><a href="images/i311.jpg">
<img src="images/i311_th.jpg" alt="" /></a><br />
<span class="caption">Such an Oh-ing and Ah-ing as Came From the Four Delighted Girls</span>
</div>



<p>Jack speedily clasped it around her neck. The
chain was just long enough for her to be able to
see the little heart as it lay against her breast. "I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
never, never believed I should ever have anything
so dear," she exclaimed. Then she turned and
caught her twin sister's hand. "But I won't wear
it," she said, "unless you have something, too."</p>

<p>This something, too, was settled upon later when
among the strands of Venetian beads was found a
string of glistening, opalescent ones which won
Jean's heart. Mary Lee's desires went out toward a
similar string of blue and silver. As was natural
with children, the ornaments were the first things
they decided upon, and then they picked out their
frocks, Aunt Sarah helping them. Nan chose a soft,
silky, creamy fabric daintily embroidered. Mary
Lee selected a blue of similar material. For the
twins it was decided that pure white would be best.
There were ribbons and sashes enough for all, and,
to cap the climax, there were several pairs of silk
stockings.</p>

<p>Nan rocked back and forth in ecstasy as she sat
on the floor surrounded by the stuffs. "It's like a
dream," she said. "I can't believe I am awake.
Oh, I want to tell mother right away. I feel just
like a fairy, I am so light."</p>

<p>"How are we to get the things made?" said
Mary Lee, bringing her sister suddenly down to
earth.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, I hadn't thought of that. Cousin
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>Polly will help us, I know, and so will Aunt Sarah,
and we can do a lot ourselves, like pulling out
bastings, and I can stitch on the machine as well as
the next."</p>

<p>"We must go right over to Cousin Polly's, then.
There isn't a minute to lose."</p>

<p>"You go," said Nan, "and bring her over here.
She will be ever so much more interested if she sees
everything and I'll leave them all out till she comes."</p>

<p>Not only did Cousin Polly come, but Cousin Mag
thought she must see the glories of the trunkful of
pretty things. Their enthusiasm was all that the
girls could wish, and after ribbons and laces, trinkets
and treasures were thoroughly examined, there
was grave discussion as to the best way to make up
the stuffs, Aunt Sarah entering into it as heartily as
any one. Cousin Polly volunteered to make Nan's
frock; Cousin Mag said she would undertake Mary
Lee's. Aunt Sarah thought she could accomplish
one of the others.</p>

<p>"And I am sure Belle Brockenborough will love
to do the other," said Polly. "She hasn't a thing
on earth to do. I'll ask her to come and stay a
week with me and we can sew and chatter and
have a good time. Anybody would love to work
on such beautiful goods as these."</p>

<p>"Oh, you dear," cried Nan. "I just knew if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>anybody could help us, it would be Cousin Polly.
Aren't we beautifully supplied with everything?"</p>

<p>"All but slippers," came from Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"Oh, I forgot slippers. I wish we could go in
our stocking feet and show off our silk stockings."</p>

<p>"We'll manage slippers somehow," said Polly.
"I am sure you can wear mine."</p>

<p>"But you have such little feet," said Nan.</p>

<p>"So have you, and I have one pair a little too
large for me, that you are quite welcome to if the
others are too small."</p>

<p>In due course of time, all were provided for.
The "little too large" pair of slippers exactly fitted
Nan. Jean's would do very well as they were. A
pair of Mary Lee's which she had grown out of it
was found Jack had grown into, and for Mary
Lee, Nan's ingenuity at last came to the rescue, for
a pair of discolored white kid slippers which had
once been her mother's, Nan suggested should be
painted blue to match her sister's frock.</p>

<p>The boys wondered at the sudden interest taken
in Betty Wise's party, for nothing else was talked
of for a week. "You didn't say a word about it
at first," said Ran. "What makes you all so wild
about it all of a sudden?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we didn't know what we were going to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>wear," Nan remarked nonchalantly, and the others
giggled.</p>

<p>However, they could not keep the presents a
secret, as Phil knew about them, and finally Nan
told Ran the whole story, ending with: "We're
just like girls in a book, aren't we?"</p>

<p>"You're the nicest girl in a book or out of it,"
returned Ran, gallantly. "I'm going to the party
with you, Nan, and I want you to dance with me a
lot."</p>

<p>"All right," said Nan, delighted at the compliment
and pleased at the thought that she and her
sisters would not be outdone by any of the girls in
matters of dress or attention.</p>

<p>The last stitch was set the day before the party,
and in full regalia the four sisters went to display
themselves to their grandmother. There was a
little embarrassment as Mary Lee came forward and
Nan said: "This is Mary Lee, grandmother."</p>

<p>But Mary Lee, full of a realizing sense of her
grandmother's generosity and completely happy in
her pretty clothes, smiled sweetly and said: "I am
very glad to see you, grandmother. You were very
kind to send us all those lovely things."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner responded quite graciously. She was
proud and pleased when she viewed the four "nice
little girls" who certainly did her credit and whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>delight in her gifts was so very obvious. Their
appreciation and pleasure gave her a warm glow of
satisfaction, and she was never more delightfully
entertaining. To add to the success of their visit,
Miss Helen took a photograph of each one, promising
them prints to send to their mother.</p>

<p>The party was all that their fancy had painted.
Not any one was better dressed than the Corners.
No one had a better time. Betty made a charming
hostess; the great old house was a bower of
beauty; the music was inspiring, the refreshments
delicious and prettily served.</p>

<p>"It was the very grandest party I ever dreamed
of," said Nan at breakfast, and all agreed with her,
even Ran who had been to more parties than the
rest and was supposed to know.</p>

<p>Although the girls, in after years, went to many
more sumptuous and brilliant entertainments, all
their lives long they looked back upon Betty Wise's
party as the one which stood out from all the rest.
"There was just one thing wanting," sighed Nan
to her Aunt Helen. "If only mother could have
seen us, I should have been perfectly happy. What
in the world shall we do without her at Christmas?"</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />

<small>CHRISTMAS GIFTS</small></h2>


<p>A new world had opened to Daniella Boggs.
Every day of her stay with the Corners some
strange and surprising fact became known to her.
The girls were a revelation in themselves, and their
appearance when they were dressed for the party
gave her a glimpse into scenes of which she had
never even dreamed. She was taught more than
words and figures by Miss Helen, and her young
mind was daily expanding, so that she became
more and more interesting to her teacher as well as
her friends. Mrs. Boggs was slowly recovering
from her hurts, and the doctor thought in a few
weeks she would be able to leave the hospital. Old
Daniel Boggs, however, failed visibly. Just what
his daughter-in-law would do in the event of his
death gave every one concern. It was learned that
Mrs. Boggs had a brother in Texas and to him
Colonel Lewis had written. All Daniella's friends
were interested to know what answer would be
made to this letter.</p>

<p>"Christmas is very near," said Nan the Saturday
after the party. "We shall have to make everything
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>this year, but fortunately there are plenty of
materials yet in grandmother's trunk."</p>

<p>"And there are the photographs," said Mary
Lee.</p>

<p>"Yes, and I mean to frame those," Nan told her.
"That can be my Christmas gift to mother. You
sew so nicely, Mary Lee, you can make her a set of
collars and cuffs."</p>

<p>"And what shall I make?" asked Jean.</p>

<p>"Why, kitty, let me see. You can make a
pretty little work-bag. It will be easy to make
and there's a lovely piece of silk in the trunk."</p>

<p>Jack was sitting with folded hands thinking
deeply. After a while she drew a long breath of
relief. "I'm going to give her my locket and
chain," she announced.</p>

<p>"Why, ducky dear," said Nan. "She couldn't
wear it for it would be too small for her, and, besides,
one shouldn't give away a particular present
like that."</p>

<p>"But it's the prettiest thing I've got," persisted
Jack, "and she can look at it, anyhow."</p>

<p>"But mother wouldn't want you to give it to
her," Nan went on. "She'd much rather you'd
make something for her. Let me see&mdash;suppose you
make a&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I don't think I'll make anything," interrupted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>Jack. "If I can't send her the chain I'll send her my
silk stockings."</p>

<p>"You ridiculous child! What on earth could
mother do with them?"</p>

<p>"She could look at them."</p>

<p>"You're a goosey goose," said Nan, affectionately,
drawing Jack to her. "You must give her
something appropriate, not anything like that. Oh,
I know what you can do. It will be fine. I almost
wish I had thought of it for myself. You can give
her one of those calendars like Aunt Helen has. It
will be just the thing. All you have to do is to get
three hundred and sixty-five sheets of paper and
take a certain number to each person whom you
select; then the person writes a verse, or a selection
or a&mdash;a&mdash;thought and signs her name. You tie
them all together and put a cover on and it makes
the nicest thing in the world for any one away from
her friends."</p>

<p>"Where shall I get the paper?" said Jack.</p>

<p>Nan had not thought of this part. "Why, I
think maybe there is some in one of the boxes in
the attic," she said reflectively; "I will look."</p>

<p>The idea of a calendar pleased Jack. The taking
around of the slips was just what she would like to
do. "What shall we have on the cover?" she
asked presently.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span></p>
<p>Nan's ingenuity again came to fill the breach. "A
photograph of this house would be fine. Ran took
a real good one, and I know he'd be glad to give a
print for the calendar. Now we have got to plan
for everybody else; there are so many this year."</p>

<p>"There is Aunt Sarah," said Jean.</p>

<p>"And Daniella," put in Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"And Mrs. Boggs," Jack reminded them.</p>

<p>"And the boys." Jean mentioned these.</p>

<p>"And Cousin Polly," added Nan. "She was so
lovely about the party frocks that we ought to give
her something very nice."</p>

<p>"Miss Belle Brockenborough was, too," said
Jean.</p>

<p>"Of course, we must remember her and Cousin
Mag. Do you suppose we'd better make something
for grandmother and Aunt Helen?" Nan asked with
an air of gravity.</p>

<p>"Not from the things they sent," said Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"No, but we could make some little things; we
must do it. Then there is Unc' Landy and Mitty
besides the Sunday-school teachers and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Miss Lawrence," put in Jean.</p>

<p>Jack made a face at this last suggestion.</p>

<p>"Now, Jack," Nan reproved her.</p>

<p>"If she hadn't such big ears, I wouldn't mind so
much," said Jack, "but they stick out so and she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>has a way with her mouth that always makes me
mad."</p>

<p>"Never mind; she is very good to you and has
stood much more than most teachers would. I'll
tell you what, Mary Lee, we'll make a lot of
panuchee and take a box to each of the teachers.
Every one says our black walnut panuchee is the best
they ever ate."</p>

<p>"Miss Lawrence asked me for the recipe," said
Mary Lee; "I hope I got it just right: a pound and a
half of brown sugar, three quarters of a cup of milk,
about a quarter of a pound of butter, and a lot of
chopped nuts. Melt the sugar and milk; let it boil
twenty minutes, add the butter and nuts, beat for
about five minutes till it gets real sugary and then
pour in pans or make it into little cakes by dropping
from a spoon. Is that right?"</p>

<p>"That is it," Nan told her. "We might make
two or three kinds. I like peanut myself."</p>

<p>"Now have we thought of everybody?" asked
Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"We haven't thought of each other," said Jack.</p>

<p>Nan laughed. "That makes three more apiece.
How they do count up. We can leave one another
till the last minute because we are right in the
house. What shall you give Daniella, Mary Lee?"</p>

<p>"I thought maybe we could find a hair ribbon in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>the trunk. She has never had one and thinks they
are so fine. They cost too much when you have to
buy them."</p>

<p>Nan approved of this. "I want to give her something
real frivolous that no one else would give
her," she said. "I know lots of people will think
of her and will send her useful things. Let's look
over what's in the trunk and pick out what we will
use. Maybe I can find something there, too."</p>

<p>This suggestion was met with universal approval,
and the four clattered up-stairs. This was the
time of day when Daniella went to see her mother
at the hospital and when Aunt Sarah was busy in
the kitchen. The four sisters gathered around the
little trunk which still held many pretty odds and
ends as yet unused. Nan did the rummaging.</p>

<p>"There, Jean," she said, tossing out a piece of
flowered silk; "that will do for mother's bag."</p>

<p>"Isn't it a lovely craulity?" said Jean, smoothing
out the silk.</p>

<p>"Here are some ends of ribbon that will do for
the strings," said Nan, dragging out some lengths
of lavender. "Oh, oh, this is exactly what I will
give to Daniella; these red beads. She will love
them, and we have plenty. There are more here.
We can give a string to Cousin Polly, these queer-looking
ones will just do for her; she loves easterny
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>looking things. And oh, Mary Lee, we can use
some of this Florentine orris and make a sachet for
Miss Belle. Here is some perfectly lovely lace.
What shall we do with it?"</p>

<p>"Make some sort of stock or something for Aunt
Sarah, and if there is enough, one for Cousin Mag."</p>

<p>"Just the ticket," cried Nan; "you're a dabster,
Mary Lee. Suppose you get a paper and pencil and
put down the things and the person's names as we
make up our minds about them; then we won't
forget what is for each."</p>

<p>Mary Lee liked to make lists and she was quick
to follow out this plan. "Three boxes of panuchee
for the three teachers," she read off. "Stocks of
lace for Aunt Sarah and Cousin Mag; beads, Polly;
beads, Daniella; sachet, Miss Belle. I think mother
ought to have a lace collar and cuffs, Nan; she
ought to have the best."</p>

<p>"Of course. Well, here's this narrower lace;
we could sew it on some thin stuff and make the
collars for the others and give mother the handsome
lace. Oh, dear, every one's present to mother will
be better than mine. Maybe I can think of something
else for her. I think each of us should give
Aunt Sarah something, and I believe I will make a
work-bag out of this." She spread out a piece of
silk on her lap. "Now, what next? Here are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>several hat-pins, six of them; we could give this
amethyst looking one to Aunt Sarah, Jean can give
that and Jack can give her&mdash;can give her&mdash;&mdash;" Nan
went on rummaging, "this dear little box. I'd like
it myself but I'll give it up to Aunt Sarah. It has
Sorrento on it, so it must have come from there.
This trunk is like somebody's bag&mdash;who was it
that had a purse or a bag or whatever it was, that
never failed?"</p>

<p>"Fortunatus, you mean." Mary Lee gave the
information.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is the person. Who is left on the list,
Mary Lee?"</p>

<p>"Let me see. Mrs. Boggs, the boys, Mitty and
Unc' Landy, ourselves, Aunt Helen and grandmother,
if you say so."</p>

<p>Nan swept something from the trunk and hid it
behind her. "I've something for you," she sang
out.</p>

<p>"That's not fair," said Mary Lee, in an aggrieved
tone. "You are right there and can pick out anything."</p>

<p>"Well," spoke up Jack, "grandmother sent it all
to her."</p>

<p>"That's so, I forgot that," said Mary Lee,
abashed.</p>

<p>"You know perfectly well that I wouldn't take
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>anything unless the rest of you had share and share
alike," said Nan, "and I'll tell you what we'll do;
each one shall have a pick in turn: three grabs
apiece and if we can't find anything we like we shall
have to make something. How will that do?"</p>

<p>All agreed that this was not only fair but generous
and one after another was sent out of the room
while the choice for her was being made, and at
last Nan shut the trunk and shoved it under the bed.
"Hasn't it been fun?" she said. "I do feel so
grateful to grandmother for sending over that trunk.
Think what has come out of it. We never in the
world could have given half the Christmas gifts nor
nearly such nice ones. What shall we give the
boys, Mary Lee?"</p>

<p>"I suppose they'd as soon have panuchee as anything."</p>

<p>"We can't all give them panuchee; they'll be ill
if we do."</p>

<p>"Then we'll have to think up something; we've
done enough planning for one day."</p>

<p>"I'm more bothered about Aunt Helen and
grandmother than any one just now, to tell you the
truth."</p>

<p>"One of them can have panuchee."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary Lee, we aren't going to set up a
candy factory."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span></p>
<p>"I know, but two or three goes of it will make
enough to give a lot of people and everybody likes
it."</p>

<p>"Well, as you say, we have done enough planning
for one day. I am going over to see Aunt
Helen now. I want to tell her what fun we had
over the trunk and besides I know she will have
some ideas for Christmas."</p>

<p>Each girl carried off her treasures and Nan set out
for Uplands, but, before she had gone far, she came
rushing back, rummaged for paper and pencil and
started forth again wearing what was called the
family cloak. This was a dark red golf cape which
was worn indiscriminately by all the members of
the family from Aunt Sarah down. The pointed
hood upon it could be taken off, by unbuttoning
it, and made a convenient pouch for the wearer
who wished to bring home any chance spoils gathered
by the way, so the cloak was always in demand.</p>

<p>It was a brisk winter's day, but too cold for a
stop at Place o' Pines, though Nan turned aside to
peep into her old shelter. As she turned from the
spot, she gave a gleeful skip. "Joy, joy," she cried,
"I have an idea!"</p>

<p>"So glad," said some one near her. "Where
are you going, West Corner?" This was Ran's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>favorite name for her and it was he as she well
knew.</p>

<p>"I am going to Uplands, but I came around this
way to look for some little wee pine cones."</p>

<p>Ran appeared from behind a tree where he had
been in hiding. "What are you going to do with
little pine cones?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I want to use them on a picture frame for
mother's Christmas gift. I have seen real pretty
frames made of them. We shall have to get
mother's Christmas box ready first and we have
none too much time. We have been having lots of
fun, Ran, planning out the presents we shall give.
It will be rather a forlorn Christmas, I am afraid,
with all we can do, for there will be no mother and
you boys will not be here."</p>

<p>"That's where you are mistaken," said Ran
soberly. "We shall be here. We are not going
home after all."</p>

<p>"You're not? Oh, dear, I'm so sorry for you,
though I am glad we shall be able to keep you; the
more the merrier, you know. What is the matter
at home, Ran?"</p>

<p>"My little sister, Leila, has scarlet fever, and, as
soon as she is well enough, they are going to take
her to Florida. That lets us out of any holiday at
home either way. Father and mother wouldn't
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>want us to be exposed to the danger of taking the
fever, and, if Leila gets well before Christmas, they
will leave anyhow."</p>

<p>"Isn't it just too bad? Well, we must try to
have as jolly a time as we can. We are in something
the same box, for we must do without our
mother, too. There will be all sorts of parties and
things going on in town, so maybe you will enjoy
yourselves more than you think; still I am very
sorry for you. Christmas anywhere except in one's
own home and with one's own family can't help
being sort of dreary."</p>

<p>Such sweet sympathy was consoling and Ran
helped her to look for the pine cones which she put
in the hood of her cloak to carry away. He
promised to help her with the wooden framework
upon which she was to glue the cones, and suggested
a quadruple frame which would look more
important than four small ones.</p>

<p>"But the glass will be harder to get," said Nan.
"I have some old photograph plates that I was
going to clean off and use for the small frames.
Ammonia cleans them beautifully."</p>

<p>"I'll attend to getting the glass for you," promised
Ran. "I know where there is a piece of glass
that will just do." The glass was at the one frame-maker's
in town and Ran meant to buy it, but he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>did not tell Nan so, knowing she would object.
Nan told him about Jack's calendar and he offered
not only to furnish the photograph they wanted but
to take several more of interiors which could be scattered
through the pages to give comfort and pleasure
to the absent mother.</p>

<p>Never before had Ran been so kind and interested
and when he left her at her grandmother's door
Nan said: "I always wanted an older brother,
Ran, to do just the things for me that you are going
to do. It is a real comfort to know you are going
to be here all through the holidays."</p>

<p>Her Aunt Helen gave her the warm greeting with
which she always met this niece for whom she
daily felt a deeper affection. Nan was so graciously
appreciative, so winsomely enthusiastic, so spontaneously
affectionate, that her aunt felt that of all
her nieces she must always love her best. Nan first
told of the pleasure they had been having in looking
over and dividing the remaining articles of the
trunk, and then she said, "There are two or three
things I want to consult you about, Aunt Helen.
We ought and want to give something to the boys,
but boys are so hard to get things for, and when
one has no money&mdash;&mdash;" She stopped short with a
blush. Never, except by accident, did she refer to
this fact in the presence of her aunt and grandmother.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>"I mean," she went on, "it is much
nicer to make something unless you can really buy
something worth while, as mother says. There are
four of us and there are two boys; that makes eight
presents, you see."</p>

<p>"Truly that is quite a number to think of," said
her aunt.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is. Mary Lee is going to give each of
them a box of panuchee&mdash;I don't know what we
should do this year if we didn't know how to make
it&mdash;so that leaves six."</p>

<p>"We shall have to put on our thinking-caps,"
said Miss Helen, meditatively. "You
could make a twine ball, for one thing; that
is cheap and easy and boys always are glad of
string."</p>

<p>"But it takes a ball of twine."</p>

<p>"I have several and shall be pleased to present
you with a couple."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No buts, please, dear; it is such a very little
thing."</p>

<p>"Oh, very well," Nan replied weakly, seeing it
would hurt her aunt to refuse.</p>

<p>"Then I am sure there must be a silk handkerchief
in that trunk."</p>

<p>"Of course there is. I never thought of that,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>and I saw it only to-day. Why that is half the
eight already."</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;let me see&mdash;did you ever see a devil penwiper
made from a wishbone? I'll show you how
to make one. It costs nothing and that makes five,
you see. I think a blotter always does very well to
give a schoolboy."</p>

<p>Nan sighed. There would be blotting paper to
be bought. Her aunt read her thought and did not
insist upon this. "A burnt match-receiver can be
easily made," she went on, "and it is nice to
give things for a boy's room when he is away from
home. There is a kind that is made by crocheting
a cover over a goblet from which the stem has
been broken."</p>

<p>"I am sure we can get that easily enough,"
laughed Nan. "I suppose worsted will do
for the crocheted part, and I have some of
that."</p>

<p>"Worsted is the proper thing. It will make a
nice, useful present."</p>

<p>"There are only two more and they can be something
very simple for the twins to give."</p>

<p>"Then a couple of little calendars will do. Two
or three have come to us from advertising houses.
We'll take off the advertisement and put the calendars
on pretty cards. There are some in the trunk,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>aren't there? So now you have every one supplied."</p>

<p>"I knew you would help us out, you dearest
Aunt Helen. Now, there is one thing more, and
this is my own secret. I am going to give mother
the photographs in a frame that I am going to
make myself, though Ran will help me, but the
others have so much nicer things and I would like
to send her something that comes right from myself,
from my inside heart, so"&mdash;she hesitated a moment.
"You know," she went on shyly, "you
said long ago you thought my little tune wasn't
so bad and I thought I'd try to write some
words that would go with the tune. Would you
mind very much helping me a little to get it all
right?"</p>

<p>"Why, darling girl, of course I shall be delighted
to give you any help within my power, and it is a
lovely thought, one I am sure your mother will appreciate."</p>

<p>"I thought of the beginning while I was coming
over here, and I went back to get a paper
and pencil, but Ran came along and I didn't have a
chance to write it down."</p>

<p>"Should you like to do it now? You can come
right up into my room, if you like. Not a soul
will disturb you, and, unless you would rather be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span>alone, I will sit there and you can consult me or
not as you like."</p>

<p>"Oh, I'd like to consult you; that is what I really
want to do; and I'm sure to be able to write what I
want when I am in your lovely room."</p>

<p>"Let us go up then."</p>

<p>For some time Nan scribbled away while Miss
Helen busied herself with some embroidery. Once
or twice the writer asked a question. "Does <i>azure</i>
rhyme with <i>to her</i>, Aunt Helen?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Then I won't try to make it." And Nan went
on, "Do you spell scanned with one <i>n</i> or two?"
she asked after a while.</p>

<p>"With two, dear."</p>

<p>Nan set to work again. After a time she looked
up anxiously. "Does <i>cheap</i> sound very badly in a
poem?"</p>

<p>"It depends. I can tell better when I see."</p>

<p>"I'll have to leave it," said Nan. "There isn't
any other word that will rhyme and make sense.
There, that's the very best I can do." She brought
her paper to her aunt who read the following:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I thought, what can I send to her<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Who is so very dear to me?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I search the skies above,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Or the sea?<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Shall I travel east and west?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall I look from south to north?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where's a gift to give my best,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Dearest mother?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But the skies are very far,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And the sea is much too deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While to travel all the earth<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Is not cheap.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, when I had scanned the blue,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Looked around, below, above,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that I could find for you<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Was my love, mother."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nan watched her aunt anxiously. "Will it do?"
she asked, wistfully.</p>

<p>Her aunt read it over again. "You have caught
the metre quite well," she said, "and&mdash;&mdash;" She
knew it could be improved, but she did not want
to take the childishness from it so she said: "Yes,
Nan, on the whole, I think it will do."</p>

<p>"And may I put words and music by Nannette
Weston Corner?" the composer asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"I think I wouldn't use the Nannette. Let us
always have the dear, homely Nancy. I have some
music-paper and you can make a copy. I will help
you."</p>

<p>Nan's starlike eyes expressed her joy. "It is
almost like having it really published," she said,
"and I know mother will like it because I did it and
it is really a part of me."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>
<p>"She would be a very cold-hearted mother not to
appreciate it," returned Miss Helen, "and that Mary
Lee is not. It is so dark, Nan, I think I'd better
send Martha home with you. Come over as soon
as you can and we'll get all these Christmas gifts
finished up."</p>

<p>Nan hugged her closely. "How in the world did
I ever get along without you?" she said.</p>

<p>"And how did I ever get along without you?"
returned Miss Helen with as warm a hug. And the
two parted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII</a><br />

<small>AN EVENING OF MUSIC</small></h2>


<p>The Christmas preparations went on famously
under Aunt Helen's directions by which all of the
girls profited, and though they worked very hard,
at last they viewed their array of gifts with much
complacency. Nan had kept the making of her
song a secret, yet probably nothing gave her such
complete pleasure, and when it was all ready,
words and music neatly written with Aunt Helen's
skilful help, Nan would like to have gazed a dozen
times a day at the page. At the top was "A Song"
done in ornamental letters. Under this was "To
my Mother," and then came "Words and Music by
Nancy Weston Corner." Miss Helen kept the precious
sheet in her charge lest some one should discover
it.</p>

<p>"You won't mind your grandmother's seeing it,
will you?" she asked Nan. "She will be so pleased
and proud." And Nan, remembering the little
trunk, could not refuse. If she had known then and
there the result she would have had no misgivings.</p>

<p>"I wish you could see what Nan has done," said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>Miss Helen, knowing well how to arouse her mother's
interest. "She is making a secret of what she
is going to give her mother at Christmas, but she
has given me leave to show it to you. I am keeping
it safe for her."</p>

<p>"Let me see it, Helen," said Mrs. Corner with
real eagerness. And Miss Helen produced the sheet
of music. Mrs. Corner scanned it interestedly. "It
seems to me the child has real talent," she remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, I think she has. I hadn't the heart to suggest
any alterations, and I know her mother would
rather the whole thing should come to her without.
You have not heard Nan at the piano, mother, for
that disabled arm has prevented her attempts. She
has a pretty touch and plays really delightfully by
ear. I wish you could hear her. I think now that
her arm seems quite well again, I shall lure her up
here to play for us some time soon."</p>

<p>"Mr. Harmer said he would be coming this way
about Christmas time," said Mrs. Corner, thoughtfully.
"He will surely stop to see us."</p>

<p>"He will be here this week, I am sure. I am expecting
a telegram any time."</p>

<p>"I'd like him to meet Nancy. Such an old friend
as he is can be relied upon to tell us whether the
child really has talent or not. Does she take music
lessons, Helen?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span></p>
<p>"They have no piano, you know, and I don't
think Mary's means allow of Nan's having lessons.
I'd like to teach her myself, and shall propose to
after Christmas, for my little Daniella will be going
then and I shall miss my occupation."</p>

<p>"They have heard from her uncle then?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Mrs. Boggs had a letter yesterday. He
has a ranch in Texas and offers to give them a
home with him. His wife is dead and he seems
greatly pleased at discovering his sister. So they
will go out to him as soon as the money can be
raised. Miss Polly Lewis is collecting contributions
to pay their expenses and has already quite a little
fund. Old Daniel Boggs cannot live the week out,
the doctor says."</p>

<p>"You may offer Miss Lewis five dollars from me,
toward the fund," said Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>"She will be glad to have it," said Miss Helen,
simply. She was pleased to see her mother taking
more interest in the things around her, in extending
her sympathies and in being willing to get
in touch with her old acquaintances.</p>

<p>A telegram the next day from Mr. Harmer announced
that he would arrive that same evening.
"We must have Nancy over," said Mrs. Corner.
"Send for her, Helen."</p>

<p>So a note was dispatched which caused great excitement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span>when Nan read it. She flew to her Aunt
Sarah. "Just think," she cried, "there is going to
be a real musician, a really great one, over at grandmother's
and they have invited me over to hear him
play this evening. I may go, mayn't I? You know
I never did hear any one like that."</p>

<p>"And you do love music so," added Miss Sarah
with a twinkle.</p>

<p>"You know I do."</p>

<p>"To-night, did you say? How will you get
home?"</p>

<p>"They will send some one with me or I could
stay all night, I suppose."</p>

<p>"You'd better come home. I'll send Ran over
about half-past nine. Go 'long, then."</p>

<p>Nan arrayed herself in her best, which, after all,
was not so very fine, and she bewailed the fact that
it was not a real party for which she had all the
necessary outfit. However, the dark blue serge
was becoming, and the corals were an addition.
Nan decided that her grandmother would be pleased
if she wore them and would overlook the shabbiness
of her frock. Few, though, would have seen
beyond the expressive face and starry eyes, and
it is certain that Mr. Harmer gave no thought to her
frock.</p>

<p>He was a gentle looking man, with iron-gray
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>hair, rather an unseeing expression, and an absent
manner; but, when he was talking of music, his
face lighted up, and his eyes lost their dreamy look.
He greeted Nan kindly, holding her hand a moment
and patting it. Then he went to the piano, and for
an hour Nan sat spellbound.</p>

<p>Into what regions of delight was she plunged.
She followed marching armies, she danced with
fairies; she wept over lost lovers; she watched
fleeting shadows; she trod a land of spring-time and
flowers. Mrs. Corner had purposely placed her
where she could watch her, and within the musician's
line of vision. Once in a while he gave a
glance at the rapt countenance and nodded significantly
at Miss Helen. Finally when the last note of
the "Moonlight Sonata" had ceased to vibrate, Mr.
Harmer turned to Nan. "Now," he said, "I want
to hear this little girl play."</p>

<p>Nan almost jumped from her seat in surprise.
"Me?" she exclaimed, with a startled look from
one to another.</p>

<p>"Yes, you, my dear," said her grandmother. "I
am very anxious that Mr. Harmer should hear what
you can do. You are able to use your arm freely
now. I'd like you, too, to show Mr. Harmer the
little song you have written."</p>

<p>There was something in Mrs. Corner's manner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>that admitted no denial of her wishes, though
Nan faltered out that she had never taken lessons,
that she knew only a very, very little about notes
and time.</p>

<p>"We all know that," said Mrs. Corner. "We
do not expect wonders, Nancy."</p>

<p>So Nan got up. As she passed her Aunt Helen,
she detained her, whispering, "Play that little air
you were trying that day I first heard you."</p>

<p>Nan nodded. Her hands were cold, her face
flushed, never had she gone through such an ordeal.
Yet she knew she must do her best and somehow
the mere pleasure of making music took from her
all fear after the first few weak notes. She played
through the little air her aunt had heard, with taste
and expression. A soft clapping of hands rewarded
her.</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer nodded approvingly at Mrs. Corner.
"Come here, my dear," he said to Nan. He took
her hand and looked at the long, slim fingers.
"Do you love music well enough to work very
hard, to give up play when you ought to practice
dull exercises, to study patiently and long?"</p>

<p>"I think so. I know so," said Nan, earnestly.
"I'd do anything to be able to play as you do."</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer smiled. "I think you needn't hesitate,
Mrs. Corner," he said. "Now, where's that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>song you were telling me of?" Nan reluctantly
brought it. Mr. Harmer looked it over without a
comment. "Do you make many tunes?" he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," returned Nan. "I make them all the
time. Sometimes I forget them very soon, and
sometimes they stay in my head and come back
again and again."</p>

<p>Mr. Harmer nodded. "Thank you, my dear. It
is a pleasure to meet such a little music lover."</p>

<p>He went back to the piano and was playing a
wonderful nocturne when Ran called to take Nan
home. Her grandmother kissed her good-night
with unusual warmth, her Aunt Helen hugged her
and Mr. Harmer shook hands cordially, saying he
hoped to live to see her a fine pianist. So Nan
went home with a glow in her heart and a faint little
hope that her grandmother would let her come
there sometimes to play.</p>

<p>The question of presents for her grandmother and
Aunt Helen remained unsettled till the very day before
Christmas, but as the children had been very
industrious with their other presents and the box to
their mother had been sent, there was little left for
them to do but to trim the tree, which the boys had
cut the day before, and which was standing in its
spicy greenness in the corner of the living-room.
"If we only had the things, we could make a fine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span>cake," said Nan. "We have eggs enough, but
Aunt Sarah says we can't afford the butter; it is so
high this time of year. I have decided to take Aunt
Helen my palm. It is looking fine."</p>

<p>"Oh, but Nan, you are so fond of it, and Mrs.
Wise sent it to you," said Jack.</p>

<p>"I know, but I must give her something I am
very fond of, for she has been so perfectly dear to me."
It was quite true that the palm was dear to Nan. It
represented a sort of tropical luxuriance in which
she delighted. She loved the outline of its shadows,
the tracery of the pointed leaves against the window
curtain, and its general aspect as it stood in one of
the front windows of the living-room. To give it
up was really a sacrifice, but one she made willingly.</p>

<p>At this moment Mary Lee came in. "Cousin
Polly wants to know if you have time to come
over there for a few minutes," she said to Nan.</p>

<p>"Of course I have," was the reply. "I'm so
glad we were not lazy over making our things for
Christmas, for now they are all done and even tied
up, so it makes me feel so free and ready to get excited
wondering what I will get myself." She ran
singing down the walk, the red golf cape around her.
"Heigho, Polly!" she cried as she went in.
"Busy?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span></p>
<p>"Oh, my dear, I'm up to my eyes, and I did so
want to make some panuchee for father; he simply
loves the kind with peanuts in it, but I haven't
time to make it; I don't suppose you have either."</p>

<p>"Why yes, I have. We've really nothing to do
but trim the tree, and that we are going to do to-night,
we older ones, though I should like mighty
well to make a cake for grandmother. It would be
mighty nice if we four girls could do each a part,
but alas, butter is high. We went without for a
week so as to have some for our panuchee, we had
the nuts and Aunt Sarah gave us the sugar, but
cake is a little beyond our means. One day's
going without butter wouldn't make even one cupful."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," said Polly stopping
her work for a moment. "If you will make my
panuchee, I'll give you all the materials for your
cake."</p>

<p>"Done!" cried Nan. "It's a bargain. Shall I
make it here or at home?"</p>

<p>"I don't care so long as it is done."</p>

<p>"Then I'll do it at home, for I am more used to
our own pots and pans. I suppose," she added,
"you won't mind if I use the scrapings for wages,
that's what we generally do."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Nan Corner?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span></p>
<p>"Why, we get the twins to shell the peanuts
and pay them for it with the scrapings and the
raggedy pieces when the stuff is done."</p>

<p>"You are quite welcome to that and a good fat
piece for each of you besides. Tell me what you
want for your cake, and I'll send Phil over with
your materials and mine."</p>

<p>"I'd like to make a lady cake; grandmother is
such a lady, and then, too, the egg yolks can be
used for something else, so it will be more economical."</p>

<p>"You are a regular old woman with your economical
ways," said Polly, going to the pantry. "I'll
send everything, Nan, even the flavoring extract and
mother's recipe which can't be beat. It's the baking
that is the most important part, remember."</p>

<p>"Oh, Aunt Sarah will help with that even if it is
for grandmother. She would never be happy to see
good materials spoiled." And Nan went off well
pleased with her bargain.</p>

<p>The candy was first made and then they set to
work on the cake. Mary Lee beat the eggs, Jack
and Jean creamed the butter and sugar together,
Nan added the other ingredients and all gave a final
stir, and, in spite of the saying that "too many
cooks spoil the broth," the cake turned out beautifully.
Aunt Sarah showed them how to ice it and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span>to stick walnut meats on top, so that it was a most
delectable piece of cookery when it was done, and
Daniella, who took a great interest in the performance,
looked at it with great admiration.</p>

<p>All these Christmas preparations were a novelty
to the little mountain girl, but they celebrated but
one event in her mind and that was the recovery of
her mother, for Mrs. Boggs was to leave the
hospital the next day and take dinner with the
Corners.</p>

<p>"I know what we can take Aunt Helen," said
Jack, as they were hanging wreaths in the living-room;
"we'll make some wreaths to take to her;
we've such a lot of greens and she'll like them."</p>

<p>The rest agreed that this was a very good suggestion,
and they set to work on them, Daniella helping
them, so that a half dozen pretty wreaths with
cheerful red holly berries set in them, were soon
ready and the big tree in the corner alone needed
the attention of their busy fingers.</p>

<p>"Daniella has never seen a Christmas tree," said
Mary Lee, "and she mustn't help. Wait till to-morrow
morning, Daniella, and you will see how
pretty we've made it. You don't mind waiting, do
you? Jack and Jean aren't going to help either."</p>

<p>"I don't mind nothin'&mdash;anythin', I mean," said
Daniella, who was improving under association and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>direction. "I'm real happy even if po' ole grandad
ain't hyah. He's havin' a better time'n we could
give him, maw says, an' he got so foolish an' helpless,
maw says he lef' us long ago."</p>

<p>"I reckon that's true," said Nan, soberly, "and
you can't help being thankful and glad when you
have your mother. I only wish our dear blessed
mother was here. I can't bear to think of Christmas
without her, and I just plunge along into whatever
comes without stopping to think."</p>

<p>"I'm glad there's going to be one mother here,"
remarked Jack.</p>

<p>If upon Christmas morning, something was
missed by the four Corners, it was a time of wonder
and delight to Daniella. Never in all her after life
did she forget the odor of the burning candles
mixed with the fragrance of the fir tree and the
sweet, appetizing, spicy smell of the gingerbread
man, the nutty candies and the orange she found
in her stocking. Never did she forget how they
all stood around the tree in the semi-darkened room
whose only light came from the candles, and sang,
"Hark the herald angels sing." Never did she forget
the wonder and pleasure on her mother's pale
face that day at dinner. She surprised her friends
with gifts. To Nan was given the little pig, to each
of the others a hen and to Miss Sarah's share fell
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>the one rooster. "I want you-alls to hev somethin'
to remember me by," she said a little shamefacedly.</p>

<p>"We'll never forget you," said the girls in chorus.
"And you'd better not forget us," added Jack.</p>

<p>Daniella gave her one look. "I ain't likely," she
said.</p>

<p>If Daniella was made happy, Nan's Christmas joy
exceeded that of any one else, for shortly after
breakfast a wagon stopped at the gate.</p>

<p>"Here comes the expressman," sang out Jean,
"and the wagon's coming in the gate. They hardly
ever do that. Oh, Nan, what a great big box."</p>

<p>Nan came to the window daintily nibbling a
chocolate from the box Ran had given her. He had
supplied each of the girls with delicious candies.
"It is a big box," she said. "I wonder what is in
it, and where it is going. I'll go to the door and
take the package."</p>

<p>"So'll I go," declared Jean who was anxious to
see.</p>

<p>"It isn't express after all," said Nan; "it's the
wagon that brings freight."</p>

<p>"Miss Nancy Corner?" said the man. "Here's
your way-bill."</p>

<p>Nan took the paper the man held out. "Where's
the package?" she asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>
<p>"Where is it? You'd better ask. You've got
the biggest present in town this day. It takes four
of us to handle it. Where'll you have it?"</p>

<p>A half suspicion was forming in Nan's brain.
She began to tremble. "I&mdash;I&mdash;don't know," she
faltered.</p>

<p>"Better have it here in the hall," said the man,
"and when it's unpacked you can move it where
you like." And the huge box was brought in and
set near the door of the living-room.</p>

<p>The men went out and Nan stood gazing helplessly
at the box while Jean ran calling: "Aunt
Sarah, Mary Lee, Jack, come see what Nan's got.
Ran, Ashby, come see."</p>

<p>Presently the man came back. "I forgot this
here was to go with it," he said, taking a note from
his cap.</p>

<p>Nan received it mechanically. She still stood
gazing at the box.</p>

<p>Ran was the first to arrive on the scene.
"Ho!" he exclaimed. "I reckon I know what
that is."</p>

<p>Nan clutched him excitedly. "What!" she
whispered, hoarsely.</p>

<p>"A piano, of course."</p>

<p>"I don't believe it, I don't. It couldn't be."</p>

<p>"Of course, that is just what it is. Ours looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>exactly that way when it came, and if you'll come
here and look on this side of the box you will see
the name of the manufacturer stamped on it."</p>

<p>Nan sank down on the floor and covered her face
with her hands. "I won't believe it, I won't, I
won't," she said. "Nobody would do such a thing
for me. Nobody would."</p>

<p>"Here, let me get a hatchet and I'll soon show
you," said Ran, going toward the kitchen.</p>

<p>"What is the matter, Nan? Have you hurt
yourself?" asked Miss Sarah, coming out into the
hall.</p>

<p>"I'm so excited it hurts," she replied, looking
up with the unopened note clasped close to
her breast.</p>

<p>Ran returned with the hatchet and they all gathered
around. One by one the boards fell away, then the
packing was revealed, and then, indeed, the shining
surface of a dear little upright piano came to view.</p>

<p>At sight of it Nan sobbed hysterically, as she
looked from one to another. "Is it mine? Are you
sure it is mine?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Why don't you read what's in that note and
find out?" said Aunt Sarah.</p>

<p>Nan opened the note and read: "A merry Christmas
to you, my dear granddaughter. May you enjoy
the piano as much as I enjoy giving it. We have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>some little presents for you all, so come over, every
one of you, and get them."</p>

<p>
"Your loving grandmother,<br />
<br />
"<span class="smcap">Grace Helena Corner</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>"It is! It is!" cried Nan ecstatically. "Grandmother
has sent it to me, and she wants us all to
come over and get more presents."</p>

<p>"Where's the cake?" cried Jack.</p>

<p>"Get the wreaths," said Jean.</p>

<p>"Here, here," said Aunt Sarah, "get this stuff
cleared away first. Come, all of you. We must
get this piano out of the hall." So they tarried long
enough to see the piano in place and then with the
cake in a basket, the wreaths on their arms and the
palm carefully protected from the too sharp winds,
they trooped forth to Uplands.</p>

<p>Nan was the first to rush into the house. She
fell on her knees before her grandmother and buried
her head in her lap. "How could you, how could
you do such a lovely thing?" she gasped out. "I
don't deserve it. Oh, grandmother, if you had
searched the world over, you couldn't have given
me anything I wanted more."</p>

<p>"That's what I thought," said Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>"I can't thank you," said Nan. "There aren't
enough words in the Century Dictionary to do it."</p>

<p>Her grandmother laughed. "Take this excitable,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>grateful creature into the other room, Helen," she
said. "You'll have to chain her down, I'm afraid, or
she'll take wings. She is ready to fly now." Nan
followed her aunt to where the other children had
been already summoned. For each, except Nan, her
Aunt Helen had a pretty book such as she knew
would most appeal to the various tastes. For each,
except Nan their grandmother had stuff for a new
frock. The material for Nan's came instead of a
book from her Aunt Helen.</p>

<p>Then the cake was presented receiving all the
praise it deserved. "It was a sweet, thoughtful
thing for you to do," said Mrs. Corner evidently
gratified. "And it is my favorite cake. Did you
know that?"</p>

<p>"Jack found out that it was," Nan told her.</p>

<p>The wreaths then were hung up and the palm
given to Aunt Helen.</p>

<p>"But, Nan, darling," said her aunt, "I know
you have given me your own palm, and that you
are very fond of it, for you have often spoken of it
to me."</p>

<p>"Do you think I would give you something I
didn't like when I love you so much?" said Nan,
indignantly, and Aunt Helen said not another word
of protest.</p>

<p>After the children had gone, Mrs. Corner sat looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span>thoughtfully into the fire, a smile upon her face.
"Next year," she said, "I shall have all my grandchildren
here to dinner. Mary will come too. She
will, won't she, Helen?"</p>

<p>"I am sure she will," said Miss Helen.</p>

<p>"It will be a great pleasure to have all Jack's
family at Uplands," continued Mrs. Corner sighing.
"I am glad we came back, Helen."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX</a><br />

<small>FIRE!</small></h2>


<p>A little after the first of the year Daniella and her
mother were on their way to Texas. Daniella's departure
was not made without tears and vows of
eternal friendship. "If I can't write very well yet,"
she said, "I'll try, and somebody kin tell me how
to spell the words."</p>

<p>"We'll all write," the four girls promised, "and
some day we shall expect to see you again."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked Daniella eagerly.</p>

<p>"We don't know just where," returned Nan,
"but one never knows what will happen in this
world, Aunt Sarah says, and so I am going to say
we will meet again." It always pleased Nan to
anticipate the improbable.</p>

<p>They all went to the station to see the Boggs's
off, and, as the train moved out, they saw a pair of
tearful eyes at the car window, and that was the
last of Daniella for many a day. Both she and her
mother had been comfortably provided for through
many contributions of clothing and money, so they
did not go away empty-handed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well," said Nan with a long sigh as they
watched the smoke from the train drift toward the
mountains, "I am glad we can think of them somewhere
else than in that lonely little cabin up there."</p>

<p>"It is a comfort," said Mary Lee, "but I really
shall miss Daniella very much, and hasn't she
learned a lot since that time we found her, a wild,
little scary thing in the mountains?"</p>

<p>"Aunt Helen says there are all sort of possibilities
in Daniella, if she ever gets any sort of a chance."</p>

<p>"She won't get much on a ranch," returned Mary
Lee.</p>

<p>"Who knows?" said Nan thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Nan's music lessons commenced before the holidays
were over. She went three times a week to
her Aunt Helen, and, although there were days when
instead of wrist movements, five finger exercises,
and close legato, she gave more time to playing
tunes by ear, on the whole, she was conscientious in
her practicing, and it took very few words to fire
her ambition or to make her appreciate the necessity
of patient striving.</p>

<p>"All musicians must go through just this uninteresting
drudgery," her aunt would tell her.
"Think, Nan, even Beethoven and Chopin and
Wagner had to train their fingers by these exercises
and scales, so you must not expect to do less."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>Then Nan would try her utmost and the next time
would show the improvement naturally following
diligent, painstaking study. It was fortunate for
her that Miss Helen knew how to appeal to her imagination
and that she varied her talks, upon the dry
details, with little anecdotes of the great masters,
and with snatches of their best compositions to illustrate
what she was saying, so that Nan, with her
knowledge of the rudiments of music, gained also a
knowledge of musical history which made her work
much more interesting.</p>

<p>At this time Nan and Mary Lee, too, were fired
with an ambition to further improve their minds, this
following certain talks with their Aunt Helen, and
they determined upon a course of reading.</p>

<p>"We'll take Macaulay's History of England," said
Mary Lee; "it will be the most useful."</p>

<p>The two girls were on their knees before the old
bookcase which held mostly old standard works, and
few modern books.</p>

<p>"We must have some maps and dictionaries and
things," said Nan, clapping the covers of a volume
together to beat out the dust. So with maps and
books of reference, they established themselves in a
quiet corner upon two or three consecutive Saturdays,
but at the end of the third Saturday, they
found themselves always starting with a sentence
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>which read: "The king had no standing army."
Beyond this, they never seemed able to go, mainly
because the book to girls of their age meant simply
a very dry record, and they found it more interesting
to read some anecdote from one of the books of reference,
and to talk about what their aunt had told
them of England of the present day. Therefore, at
last Macaulay was laid aside, and the only fact
they remembered reading from the book was that
the king had no standing army.</p>

<p>Although Miss Sarah had never set foot across the
brook, she tacitly permitted the intercourse between
the two families, and even admitted that Miss Helen
was not to be included in the censure which she so
sweepingly bestowed upon her mother. Of the
children's grandmother, she would never speak, and
only by a toss of the head and a sarcastic smile did
they know that she had not altered her opinion of
the elder Mrs. Corner. Every attention or gift the
girls received was attributed to the influence of Miss
Helen, and Miss Sarah honestly believed that in her
opinion she was right.</p>

<p>As for Miss Helen, she never came to her sister-in-law's
house. "I am biding my time," she told her
mother. "When Mary comes back, I think we shall
have matters on a different footing."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I can never bring myself to going
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>there," sighed Mrs. Corner. "I'm too old to give up
all my prejudices, Helen, but I shall try to meet my
son's wife half way."</p>

<p>"If I know Mary Gordon Lee," said Helen, "you
will not have to go even half way."</p>

<p>And indeed there was no going half way for anybody,
as an occurrence soon changed everything for
those who lived at Uplands. It took place one
night when the winds of March were sweeping
through the mountain forests, sighing through the
pines in Nan's summer retreat, and uncovering the
young pushing blades, already started from the
ground down by the brook.</p>

<p>Nan, who was a light sleeper, was startled from
her slumbers by the dashing by of engines, and by
hearing cries of "Fire!" She slipped out of bed and
drew aside the curtains to look out, wondering if the
barn on their own place could have caught, but it was
beyond the brook that the sky was red and the
flames were mounting high. In an instant, she
realized where the danger was. She rushed to the
boys' door. "Ran, Ran," she cried, banging on the
door, "Uplands is on fire!" She stopped to pound
on her Aunt Sarah's door. "Uplands is on fire!"
she cried. Then she ran back to her own room and
slipped on her clothes.</p>

<p>In a few minutes the bolt rattled at Ran's door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>and he went flying down-stairs, two steps at a
time. Then Aunt Sarah appeared in her dressing
gown. "What was it you were saying, Nan?"
she asked.</p>

<p>Nan was at the window. "Just come here and
see," she said, and Aunt Sarah joined her. "Goodness!"
she exclaimed. The fire was burning more
fiercely now, fanned by the high winds. They
could hear the "Chug, Chug" of the engines, the
crackle of the burning, the hoarse cries of the
men.</p>

<p>A sob arose in Nan's throat. "I can't bear to look
at it, and yet it fascinates me," she said. "Oh,
Aunt Sarah, do you suppose they are safe? I wish
I could go and see."</p>

<p>"Not a step do you go," decided Aunt Sarah.
"I'm going down to put some water to boil and be
on hand if I'm wanted. You'd better go back to
bed. The others are all fast asleep and that's what
you ought to be."</p>

<p>"As if I could sleep," said Nan. "Please let me
come down-stairs."</p>

<p>"Come along, then," said Aunt Sarah. And Nan
followed.</p>

<p>In a short time there was a sound of voices outside
and a knock at the door, then Ran came rushing
in. "They are bringing Mrs. Corner and Miss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>Helen here," he said. "I told them to. That was
right, wasn't it? This is the nearest house."</p>

<p>"It was quite right," returned Miss Sarah, stiffening
herself, but going to the living-room to make a
light, and then to the front door, candle in hand.
"Bring them right in," she said, speaking to the
forms moving about in the darkness.</p>

<p>"It took a little while to get a carriage," spoke up
one of the men, "and the ladies had to stand outside
for a time. They'd better have something
warm."</p>

<p>Miss Sarah opened the door to admit first Mrs.
Corner, helped along slowly by two men, and then
Miss Helen. Both had blankets thrown around
them over their night-dresses, and both were in
their bare feet. "Right in here," repeated Miss
Sarah.</p>

<p>The men established Mrs. Corner upon the old
threadbare sofa, and Miss Helen sank into a rocking-chair.
Nan had immediately gone back to the
kitchen and presently appeared with two cups of
steaming coffee. She went over at once to the sofa.
"Won't you drink this, grandmother?" she said.
"It will do you good."</p>

<p>"I am very cold, very cold," returned Mrs. Corner
weakly. "Where am I?" she asked as the sense
of warmth pervaded her.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>
<p>"At our house grandmother," Nan answered.</p>

<p>"Where's Helen?" she asked with a bewildered
look.</p>

<p>Miss Helen came to her. "Here I am, mother
dear, perfectly safe. Drink this hot coffee and you
will feel better."</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner took the coffee obediently and then
lay back with closed eyes. Nan threw her arms
around her Aunt Helen. "Darling," she said,
"please drink your coffee, too, before it gets cold,
and come over here by the stove."</p>

<p>"I'll sit by mother," returned Miss Helen. "Never
mind about me."</p>

<p>"But I do mind about you," said Miss Sarah,
standing over her with the coffee. "Drink this
right down, Miss Helen." And Miss Helen, with a
forlorn little smile, obeyed.</p>

<p>"We must get your mother straight to bed," Miss
Sarah continued. "I'll go up and get ready for her.
Do you think you could help me carry her up, Ran?"
she asked the boy, who was standing by.</p>

<p>"Indeed I can!" he answered. And in a few
minutes both Mrs. Corner and her daughter were in
Miss Sarah's own bed, and that capable person was
grimly seeing to their comfort.</p>

<p>Little was said on either side, but after Miss Sarah
had placed hot bricks to Miss Helen's icy feet, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>leaned over her and said: "Now, go to sleep and
don't worry."</p>

<p>"But we are giving you so much trouble, Miss
Dent," said Miss Helen, "and besides&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What are we in this world for?" said Miss
Sarah. "And as for the rest of it, you're where
you ought to be. I know what Mary would want.
All you have to do is to get warm and go to sleep."
But as she crossed the hall, Miss Sarah drew a long
sigh. "I wonder what next," she said. "I suppose
the Lord thought He'd teach me and that proud
old woman a lesson, and we're learning it here side
by side."</p>

<p>Nan laid her cheek against her Aunt Sarah's hand.
She had a very good idea of what a bitter lesson it
was, and of how hard it was to Aunt Sarah Dent to
offer hospitality to Mrs. Corner.</p>

<p>"You're very good to do all this," she said, "and
to give up your own room, Aunt Sarah."</p>

<p>"I'll slip into your place by Mary Lee," said Aunt
Sarah, "and you can get in with the twins; theirs
is a mighty wide old bed. I wouldn't turn a dog
out under such circumstances, and if Grace Corner
can stand it, I can."</p>

<p>They were all at breakfast when Miss Helen came
down the next morning. Nan had laid out some of
her mother's clothing for her, which sat strangely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span>upon Miss Helen's little figure. "Mother is sleeping,"
she said, "and I would not disturb her. I am
afraid she is a little feverish." She turned to Ran.
"Was anything saved, do you know?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Quite a lot of furniture and some of the pictures,
I believe," he told her.</p>

<p>"Grandmother's portrait, I hope," spoke up Nan.</p>

<p>"Yes, that was saved, I am sure. It is a little
hard to know just what is safe, for everything is so
soaked with water in the rooms that were not
actually burned, that we can't tell just yet. Half the
house is burned out entirely, only the walls stand on
that side."</p>

<p>Miss Helen drew a long sigh. "We were to have
been very happy there for the rest of our lives," she
said plaintively.</p>

<p>"What's become of Baz?" asked Jack anxiously.
The children were much excited over the strange
news that had met them when they awoke that
morning.</p>

<p>"I found Baz in a fence corner," Ran told Jack.
"He was scared to death at first but I managed to
catch him, and bring him over here. Lady Gray
seemed to recognize him at once and they are
snuggled up in the box with Ruby."</p>

<p>Jack looked greatly pleased. Her own had come
to her again.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>
<p>Miss Helen said little. There were great circles
around her eyes and she was very pale. After
breakfast she went to Miss Sarah.</p>

<p>"I know it is hard for you to have us here," she
said, "and I cannot consent to giving you extra
care. I know how you must feel."</p>

<p>"My dear," said Miss Sarah, "I have no right to
feel. It is Mary's house, and I am simply doing as
I know she would wish to do. I am not to be considered
at all in the matter."</p>

<p>Miss Helen looked at her wistfully and Miss Sarah's
face softened. "Please don't give yourself
any anxiety," she went on. "When I saw your
mother, feeble and dependent; when I saw your
white hair, Helen Corner, and realized what the
years had done for you, and that you were homeless
by the power of the Almighty's elements, do
you think I did not understand that He meant to
teach me, too, not to set up my puny little will
against His? We are all children of one Father and
you are one of my sisters."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Miss Helen gently. "I understand,
too, and I thank you. Now, please, may I
tell you of a little project of mine?"</p>

<p>Miss Sarah drew up her chair and the two sat
down. "I have been thinking," began Miss Helen,
"that we could be very comfortable in the wing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>of this house. There are the two rooms up-stairs
besides the attic and the three rooms down-stairs,
including the office which we could use as a
kitchen. Couldn't we move over such of our things
as are saved from the fire and settle there, for the
present, at least? Do you think Mary would object?"</p>

<p>"I think Mary would say it was the very thing
to do, if it suited you."</p>

<p>"I think it would be better for mother to have a
place she could call home. This is where she lived
when she was first married, before my grandparents
died and she went to Uplands. It is familiar
to her. She could be near the children and yet
could have the quiet which she is accustomed to.
We can have Martha to do our work and I do not
see that we could do better. Then, too," she
paused in some embarrassment, "mother would
want to pay a generous rent."</p>

<p>Miss Sarah raised her hand. "That must be
settled by you and Mary," she said. "As for the
rest, I know she will consent."</p>

<p>"Then will you send for Martha? And I am
sure we shall be able to get settled very soon."</p>

<p>The result of this planning was that within a
week Miss Helen and her mother were established
in the old wing. During the time of preparation,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>Mrs. Corner did not leave her room, and seemed still
dazed and shattered, but was quiet and docile, seldom
showing any evidence of her old spirit. The
furniture saved was supplemented by such new
pieces as were needed and it really was a cozy little
home into which Miss Helen took her mother.
There was no lack of helpers. Friends, neighbors
and kinsfolk were only too ready to lend their aid,
though by far the most eager were the boys and
girls of the house, who were willing runners of
errands and did much toward making the rooms
pretty and cozy.</p>

<p>Still, from the moment of her removal from Uplands,
Mrs. Corner failed visibly. She rallied a little
after going into the rooms prepared for her, and
took a passing interest in them, but it was only a
short time after that she grew weaker and at last
could not even leave her bed. "It is the shock
and the exposure," said Dr. Ward, looking grave
when Miss Sarah questioned him. "I doubt if she
gets over this, but we must try to keep Miss Helen
in good heart." And with the knowledge that a
broken, feeble old woman was nearing the brink of
the dark river, the last vestige of ill-will left Miss
Sarah, and she was a tower of strength to Miss
Helen in her hour of trial.</p>

<p>The wind-swept, blackened rooms of the house
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>at Uplands gave the children an awed feeling
whenever they looked that way. From those of
the rooms which were not completely burned out,
the water-soaked furniture had been removed, except
where, here and there, a scorched piece of
drapery flapped from some broken window, or a
charred article of furniture was visible through
the gaps in the walls. The fire had started in a
defective flue and one side of the house was in
complete ruins.</p>

<p>It was a desolate sight to those who had known
and loved its inmates, and of these perhaps the chief
mourner was old Unc' Landy who, in spite of his
railings at the former mistress of the mansion, now
felt for her only pity. "Hit sho is hard fo' a
proud uprighteous pusson lak ole miss ter give
up all dese yer flesh-pots ob Egyp'," he said to
Nan, "de quails an' de manna an' de gol'en calf
what she been a hankerin' arter in de days ob huh
youf. Yas, Lord, yuh done lay yo' han' mighty
heaby on huh, an' I suttinly does groan in spi'it
when I sees how de mighty fallen. I sholy does
wrastle wid de Lord in de night season implorin'
Him to hab mercy on huh po' soul."</p>

<p>Such talk was awe-inspiring to the children, not
one of whom thought of anything but the favors
their grandmother had shown them, and all of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>whom were ready and eager to do the least thing
they could to add to her comfort or to their Aunt
Helen's.</p>

<p>"It means so much to have you dear children so
near," said Miss Helen many times a day. "I don't
know what I should do without you."</p>

<p>The March winds were still and the April rains
were falling gently when the end at last came to
Grandmother Corner's days on earth. In the early
evening of a spring Sabbath she called clearly:
"Mary Lee, Mary Lee!"</p>

<p>Nan ran for her sister. "Grandmother wants
you," she said, and Mary Lee wondering, hurried in
to receive no look of recognition. She was as a
stranger to her grandmother.</p>

<p>"Here is Mary Lee," said Nan bending over her.</p>

<p>Mrs. Corner shook her head. "Mary Lee, Mary
Lee," she whispered.</p>

<p>"It is your mother whom she is calling," said
Aunt Sarah as the patient dozed again.</p>

<p>Presently there came a second call: "Helen,
Helen!"</p>

<p>"I am here, mother!" said her daughter.</p>

<p>The mother opened her eyes and looked at the
little figure by her side. "You will be just,
Helen," she said. "Jack was my child as well as
you, and his children must have what is right."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span></p>
<p>"They shall have it," said Miss Helen, laying her
cheek against her mother's frail-looking hand.</p>

<p>"There was a will&mdash;I forget," and again she
dozed.</p>

<p>Aunt Sarah spoke to Nan. "You and Mary Lee
go now into the next room. I will stay here, and
if Miss Helen wants you, I will call you."</p>

<p>The dusk was settling down on the earth, the
mountains were dimly seen through a mist of rain.
"There are shadows everywhere," said Nan, as she
stood looking out of the window. Jack and Jean
were staying with their Cousin Mag, but the two
elder girls had kept close together all day.</p>

<p>The dusk had faded into twilight when there was
a slight movement in the next room, then the girls
heard a footstep on the stair and some one hurried
along the hallway. They went to the door.
"Where is she?" they heard some one say, and
they looked to see their Aunt Helen clasped in the
arms of their own mother and heard her say:
"Oh, Mary, Mary, you are all I have left me now,
you and the children."</p>

<p>It was one lovely day in June that Nan hied her to
Place o' Pines. She gazed with a half smile at the
old log of wood on which the music rack was still
fastened. No need now to pretend a piano she remembered
with pride and pleasure. She began
softly to sing the old tune but this time Little
Jamie was not the refrain, but that other one:
Dearest Mother.</p>

<p>"The very nicest thing in all the world is a
mother," she said to herself. "I believe just as
Dr. Woods said to Aunt Helen the other day; she
made me say it over so I wouldn't forget it: 'The
Being who could conceive and create a good mother
must Himself be perfect love.'"</p>

<p>"Nan, Nan," came the voice of some one calling
from afar.</p>

<p>Nan started up and listened, then she crept out of
the opening in the pines and ran around to the
fence, giving the peculiar call which the Corner
children always used in answering one another.
"Where are you?" Mary Lee's voice came nearer.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[Pg 374]</a></span>There was an excited and triumphant ring in
it. Evidently, she had something important to
tell.</p>

<p>"Here I am," said Nan, squeezing herself through
the fence and meeting her sister on the other side.
"What do you want me for, Mary Lee?"</p>

<p>"You ought just to hear what mother and Aunt
Helen and Aunt Sarah have been talking about;
the most exciting things. Come over here and I'll
tell you." Mary Lee spoke importantly. It was
generally Nan who was the dispenser of news, and
Mary Lee seldom had the chance of taking the role
of herald, in consequence she carried herself with
the little air of superiority which Nan generally assumed
upon such occasions.</p>

<p>Nan followed her to a patch of grass by the side
of the fence, and they sat down together. This
summer the two were more frequently companions,
for Phil had suddenly discovered a preference for
the company of boys, and was generally with Ashby
and Ran pursuing more masculine sports than Mary
Lee cared to join.</p>

<p>"We're not likely to be here six months from
now," Mary Lee began with a view to making a
sensation.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said Nan, startled out of
a pretended indifference.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[Pg 375]</a></span></p>
<p>"Just what I say. Of course, Aunt Sarah and
the boys will be here but we shall not."</p>

<p>"Oh, Mary Lee, we are not to be sent away to
boarding-school, are we?" asked Nan in a horror-stricken
voice.</p>

<p>Mary Lee hugged her knees and rocked back and
forth in enjoyment of the situation. "No, we're
not going to boarding-school. Oh, Nan, it will be
perfectly splendid, and you've always longed to
travel, you know. It will be so fine to see oranges
growing, and all sorts of things, olives and lemons
and such oceans of flowers. You used to make
such a fuss over that one little palm, and how you
will revel in the things we shall see."</p>

<p>"I think you might tell me what you are talking
about," said Nan impatiently.</p>

<p>But Mary Lee was enjoying her unwonted pleasure
of news-giving too much to let out all her information
at once and she went on, "Of course we
shall not travel so very much after we once get there
for it will be better that mother should settle down
in some one place where it will agree with her.
Aunt Helen says we must not give up our studies,
and that you especially must keep up your music,
so we shall probably take some little cottage where
we can have a piano. It would be fun to have a
Chinese servant, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[Pg 376]</a></span></p>
<p>Nan was too quick-witted to let this hint pass.
"I know now!" she cried exultantly. "It's California.
Now, Mary Lee, don't fool about it any
more, but just begin at the beginning and tell me."</p>

<p>Seeing that there was no use in further holding
off, Mary Lee smoothed down her frock and began.
"Well, I just happened to be on the porch outside
the living-room when it all started, and I went in
and listened; they let me. It began by mother's
saying that the doctor told her it would be perfectly
safe to stay here during the summer, but that when
November came she must go away again. He said
that if she would do that for two or three years he
was sure that she could get over all her symptoms.
'It makes my heart sink when I think of being
separated for even one more winter from my children,
but it must be done,' said mother, 'and it is
fortunate that the boys want to come back and that
I shall be able to cover my expenses.'</p>

<p>"Then Aunt Helen spoke up. 'Don't say anything
about expenses, Mary,' she said; 'you know
it was mother's wish that the estate should be
divided, and though she did not sign that last will,
I consider it just as binding as if she had done it.'
Oh, Nan, she said she meant to have grandmother's
first will set aside so we could have our share lawfully."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[Pg 377]</a></span></p>
<p>"That is just like Aunt Helen," said Nan.
"Go on."</p>

<p>"Then they talked about that for a little while
and said a lot about lawyers and trustees and
things I didn't understand, then Aunt Helen said,
'What do you think of California for a winter,
Mary?'</p>

<p>"'But it is so far,' said mother, 'and it is such an
expensive trip. I should like it better than the Adirondacks,
but for the distance. But I couldn't be so
far from my children. Of course,' she said, 'you
and Aunt Sarah would be here, and that would be a
great comfort.'</p>

<p>"'I didn't mean for you to go alone,' Aunt Helen
said; 'I meant that the children and I would go,
too.'</p>

<p>"Mother turned right around and put her hand on
Aunt Sarah's. 'But what would my dear auntie
do?' she asked.</p>

<p>"'Don't mind me,' Aunt Sarah said. 'I'll manage.
If you want to close the house, I'll go to Henry
Dent's or somewhere, but if you'd rather keep it
open I should like mighty well to stay right here
and look after those boys, and perhaps I could get
a couple more to come in, so it would keep me
interested and occupied.'</p>

<p>"Then I spoke right up, Nan."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[Pg 378]</a></span></p>
<p>"What did you say?" asked Nan, eagerly.</p>

<p>"I said, 'Oh, do let Aunt Sarah stay, mother, for
who would take care of old Pete, and what would
Lady Gray and Baz and Ruby do without any
family, and then there's Unc' Landy and the pig and
the chickens.' Then they all laughed, though I
don't know why and mother said: 'That settles it,
Mary Lee. If Aunt Sarah wants to take such a large
family under her wing, I am sure I have no objection.'</p>

<p>"Then Aunt Helen said: 'I've only one thing to
say, Mary. If Miss Sarah is to undertake all this, I
hope you will feel that you have enough to let her
have all she can make out of her&mdash;her&mdash;&mdash;'"</p>

<p>"Her experiment," suggested Nan who had a more
ready vocabulary than Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"I think she said 'undertaking,'" said Mary Lee,
not to be corrected. "Then I said: 'Are we really
going to California, Aunt Helen?' And she said, 'I
should like to think so. It all rests with your
mother. I have always wanted to go there and I
can't bear to be parted from you all, so why can't
we go together?' Then she asked mother what
she thought about it."</p>

<p>"She said yes, of course," put in Nan.</p>

<p>Mary Lee nodded. "Uhm&mdash;hm. She did indeed,
and I got up and just yelled, and then I told
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[Pg 379]</a></span>them I was going hot-foot to find you, and I left
them there still talking about it."</p>

<p>"Oh, do let's go back and hear the particulars,"
said Nan. "Isn't it perfectly wildly exciting? Did
you ever believe such a thing could happen to us?
To think we are all going. I wonder when we
shall start, and where we shall go, I mean the exact
place. To think of living, really living there.
Come, let's find out more."</p>

<p>They went racing toward the house and burst in
upon the three ladies still absorbed in making plans.
"Are we really going to California?" asked Nan,
excitedly. "When shall we start? What place is
our cottage to be in? May I take some of my
books? What trunk shall I use?"</p>

<p>All three smiled. "Gently, Nan, gently," said
her mother. "We are not going to-morrow, and
there will be plenty of time to decide on trunks before
October."</p>

<p>Nan drew a long sigh, and went to sit down by
her Aunt Helen. "Fairy godmother," she said,
"the Poppy fairy never brought me this dream.
Just wave your wand, please, and make me see it
all."</p>

<p>"We shall go to Southern California," said Miss
Helen, drawing Nan close to her, "probably to San
Diego or Pasadena. We shall travel a little at first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[Pg 380]</a></span>and decide upon the best place for your mother,
then we will take a little cottage, hire a piano, have
some books, engage a teacher for you girls, and settle
down to enjoy our winter."</p>

<p>"Do let's have a Chinese servant."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we can try one."</p>

<p>"And we can have a garden?"</p>

<p>"If we can find a house with one attached. I
think it is extremely probable that we will have one.
A little cottage of about six or eight rooms will be
large enough, I think, and, if we can, we will have
a garden where the geraniums will grow so high
that they will shade our second story windows, and
where roses will bloom in January. We will not be
too far from orange groves and olive orchards nor
too distant from the city, and we must be near
enough to slip over into Mexico and to have the
Pacific ocean for a neighbor. We shall hear
Spanish spoken, and the ancient missions will give
an old world air to our surroundings. We shall be
where your mother will gain strength and health,
and where you will have the opportunity of learning
all sorts of new things, where I shall try to forget
many sad things of my old life, and shall feel that I
have a sister and her children to make me content
and give me a new peace. Do you like the picture,
West Corner?"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[Pg 381]</a></span></p>
<p>"It is beautiful. Now it all seems real. I can
see everything, dearest, it's lovely. Just one thing
more: How do we go?"</p>

<p>"I think we shall take the southern route and
come back by some other."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;&mdash; Just which way is the southern
route?"</p>

<p>"Down through New Orleans, Texas, and a bit
of Mexico, then up through Southern California.
Coming back, we will go through upper California
and perhaps come home through the Canadian
Rockies, but we will decide that when the time
comes."</p>

<p>Nan drew a long sigh of satisfaction. "It is just
too lovely for words. I may tell it, may I? It's all
going to really happen?"</p>

<p>"So far as any one can say a thing will really
happen. Of course, if any one should go prowling
around at night in strange places and break an arm
or leg and so detain us, we all could not go."</p>

<p>Nan fell upon her aunt with playful beatings of
her fist in punishment of this speech. "It won't be
me, at any rate," she declared. "I'm going to hunt
up the kiddies now before Mary Lee gets hold of
them to tell them."</p>

<p>Mary Lee had already flown to Cousin Mag's
with the news and Nan was free to be first dispenser
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[Pg 382]</a></span>of it to the twins. She was but a little way
from the house when Jean met her, running, and
wiping away tears with two grimy fists. "Whither
away, my little maid?" cried Nan, catching her.
"Where's Jack?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Nan," said Jean, "come, come crick; Jack
is in the pig-pen and the pig is screaling awfully."</p>

<p>"Why in the world did Jack want to get into the
pig-pen with the pig?" asked Nan. "Did she
want to make piggy 'screal'?"</p>

<p>"No, she fell in. Come, get her out, please,
Nan."</p>

<p>Nan followed Jean to the scene of the disaster,
but, by the time they reached there, Jack had managed
to get out by her own efforts, though she was
a sight to behold. "Goodness, child!" exclaimed
Nan, "you are a mess. What have you been doing?
Here, come along with me. Don't touch me.
Unclean! Unclean! Fee-ugh! how does the pig
stand that kind of sachet? Go on ahead&mdash;&mdash; No,
keep behind. I don't notice it so much, then. Follow,
follow." She ran on ahead until she reached
the brook, whose waters were warmed by the June
sunshine. "Off with your shoes and jump right
in," she cried to Jack; "into that nice little smooth
pool where the sun is shining. You are the pilgrim
in 'Pilgrim's Progress,'" she went on, "and I see
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[Pg 383]</a></span>that the dirt of the Slough of Despond is upon thee,
but that slough is the beginning of the sorrows that
do attend those that go on in that way. Hear me, I
am older than thou; thou art like to meet within
the way that thou goest, Wearisomeness, Pain,
Hunger, Perils, Nakedness, Sword, Lions, Dragons,
Darkness&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, Nan," wailed Jack, "don't scare me any
more than I was scared. The pig's little wicked
eyes looked at me so fierce and he grunted and
grunted and tossed up his nose."</p>

<p>"Like Tiny in the song Aunt Sarah sings. Never
mind, dear, I was only quoting 'Pilgrim's Progress,'
and you mustn't be scared. Piggy Wee shan't eat
little Jack Corner. Jump, jump, jump, froggy.
There you go. Splash about and I'll run home for
some dry things while you are soaking off the
worst."</p>

<p>It was pleasant and warm in the sun and Jack
splashed about manfully, rather enjoying it, until
Nan returned with the dry clothes in which she was
invested after being stripped of the foul garments
and washing herself well in the pool into which
Nan poured a quantity of ammonia.</p>

<p>"Now you are clothed in the King's robes," said
Nan, continuing her simile of the pilgrim. "I think
you'll do. We'll leave these earth-stained garments
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[Pg 384]</a></span>to sweeten in the sun and you can tell me how it all
happened."</p>

<p>"I wanted to help Piggy Wee to get some parings
that had fallen outside. I was climbing up and
throwing them over when I slipped and fell in and
he didn't like it," said Jack, mournfully. "It was
real ungrateful of him, too, for I was doing it for
his sake and he squealed and did his ears funny and
looked like he wanted to gobble me up."</p>

<p>"Somebody will gobble him up some day," said
Nan, comfortingly, "for he will have to be killed in
the fall and made into sausage meat for ground-hog
day. Now let me tell you something perfectly
lovely that will make you forget all about pigs.
Come, Jean! Ah, Jean!" for this one of the twins
had wandered further up the brookside.</p>

<p>With one of the little girls each side of her, Nan
poured forth her news as they sat by the purling
little stream. She had two absorbed listeners who
at first thought she was telling them a make-believe
story, but she ended by assuring them that it was
every word true and concluded by saying: "So
now, my sweet pilgrims, we shall soon be going to
the Delectable Land where there will be no pig-pen
to fall in and where we can sit under orange trees
and eat oranges all day."</p>

<p>For a time, the children gave themselves up
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[Pg 385]</a></span>to pleasant dreams. Overhead the leaves softly
whispered, at their feet sang the little brook; in the
distance Unc' Landy was crooning an old camp-meeting
hymn. "I'm sure, after all, it's pleasant
enough here," said Jack, breaking the silence.</p>

<p>Nan raised her eyes to the charred ruins of Uplands'
house rearing themselves upon the hill opposite.
She drew a long breath. "If as much
happens next year as has happened this," she said,
"I don't know what I shall do. I feel as if I
had grown three feet and that all the little shelves
in my brain where I store away things were piling
up so fast that it will be necessary to build an
extra room pretty soon."</p>

<p>Jack laughed. "You do say such funny things,
Nan."</p>

<p>"So do you," returned Nan. "There come Mary
Lee and the boys. Let's go meet them."</p>

<p>They passed by the little gardens where the boys
had lent a hand in spading and hoeing. The
young green of shoots appeared above the brown
earth; green peas were filling in their pods, beans
were climbing their poles; even the asparagus bed
was started, and on the currant bushes hung
bunches of green currants. Giant Pumpkin Head had
begun to stretch his lusty limbs outside Place o' Pines.
To Nan's fancy, he was guardian of the place.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[Pg 386]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am glad we aren't going away in summer,"
she said, observing all the familiar things. "I'm
glad, too," she went on, "that the boys have to be
here several years longer, so it isn't as if we
shouldn't come back to just the same things."</p>

<p>"We shan't come back to the old fence," said
Jean; "that's gone."</p>

<p>"And a good riddance that was. Aunt Helen
says next thing the house must be painted, but I
don't know that I want it to be," said Nan half
regretfully; "it won't seem like our own old dingy
dear home. I don't like spick and span things
always."</p>

<p>"I am sure the sofa looks fine in its new cover,"
said Jean.</p>

<p>"Yes, but you have to keep your feet off it," said
Jack, resentfully.</p>

<p>There was a sober look on Ran's face as he came
up with the other two boys and Mary Lee.</p>

<p>"What do you think of our good news?" said
Nan.</p>

<p>"I don't think it is very good news," he replied.</p>

<p>"You don't? Why not?" asked Nan, opening
wide her eyes.</p>

<p>"Because we shall miss you all so awfully
when we come back next year, and the house is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[Pg 387]</a></span>going to be painted, too, so it won't seem a bit the
same."</p>

<p>"That's just what I've been saying," Nan told
him. "Oh, well," she added, philosophically, "I
suppose we shall get used to it, and will forget
that the house ever was no color. You'll get used
to doing without us, too, and think what a lot we
shall have to tell when we get back."</p>

<p>Ran still looked gloomy. It did not add to the
pleasure of his thoughts to feel that the girls would
outdo him in experiences. "I mean to go to
Europe when I finish college," he said.</p>

<p>"But first," said Nan, "you're going home, so I
don't see but that we are the first ones to be left
behind, Mr. Longface. Cheer up, cheer up, we've
a whole week yet before the holidays begin.
Let's all go for a ride up the mountain; it's just the
day for it."</p>

<p>An hour later the seven had turned their faces
toward the steadfast mountains upon which no
changes were ever wrought.</p>
